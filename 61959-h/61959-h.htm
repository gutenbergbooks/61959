PREFACE
</p>

<p>
These Memories were written in the first
instance for Americans and have appeared
week by week each Sunday in the <i>New York
Tribune</i>.  This may be evident enough from the
way in which some subjects are dealt with.  But
they must stand in great part as they were written
since the book is published both in London and
New York.
</p>

<p>
They are, in some slight degree, autobiographical,
but only so far as is necessary to explain my
relations with those men and women of whom I have
written, or with the great journal, the <i>New York
Tribune</i>, I so long served.  But they are mainly
concerned with men of exceptional mark and
position in America and Europe whom I have met,
and with events of which I had some personal
knowledge.  There is no attempt at a consecutive
story.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
NEW ENGLAND IN 1850&mdash;DANIEL WEBSTER
</h3>

<p>
My memories begin with that New England
of fifty years ago and more which has pretty
well passed out of existence.  I knew all or nearly
all the men who made that generation famous:
Everett; Charles Sumner, "the whitest soul I
ever knew," said Emerson; Wendell Phillips;
Garrison; Andrew, the greatest of the great "War
Governors"; Emerson; Wendell Holmes; Theodore
Parker; Lowell, and many more; and of all I shall
presently have something to say.  Earlier than
any of them comes the Reverend Dr. Emmons, a
forgotten name, for a long time pastor of the little
church in the little town of Franklin, where I was
born, in Norfolk County, in that State of
Massachusetts on which Daniel Webster pronounced the
only possible eulogy: "I shall enter on no
encomium upon Massachusetts; she needs none.  There
she is.  Behold her, and judge for yourselves.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
There is her history; the world knows it by
heart."  Whether the world knows it by heart may be a
question.  We are perhaps a little too apt to
assume that things American loom as large to
other eyes as to our own.  But whether the world
knows Massachusetts by heart or not, we know
it; and the rest does not much matter.  Every
son of hers will add for himself "God bless her."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Emmons was of the austere school of
Calvinists, descending more directly from the still
more austere school of Jonathan Edwards.  I
cannot have been more than three or four years
old when I last saw him, but I see him still: tall,
slight, bent, wasted; long grey locks floating
loosely about his head; his face the face of an
ascetic, yet kindly, and I still feel the gentle touch
of the old man's hand as it rested on my baby
head.  And I see the imprint of his venerable
feet, which it was his habit to rest on the painted
wainscotting of his small, scantily furnished study.
</p>

<p>
My father was first his colleague, then his
successor; then was called, as the phrase is, to
the Second Congregational Church in Worcester;
whence he passed many years later to the First
Presbyterian Church in Troy, N.Y., where he
died.  Worcester was at that time&mdash;1840 to
1860&mdash;a charming example of the thriving New
England village which had grown to be a town
with pleasant, quiet streets&mdash;even Main Street,
its chief thoroughfare, was quiet&mdash;and pleasant
houses of colonial and later styles standing in
pleasant grounds.  A beautiful simplicity of life
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
prevailed, and a high standard; without pretence,
not without dignity.  The town had given, and
was to give, not a few Governors to the
Commonwealth: Governor Lincoln, Governor Davis
("Honest John"), another Lieutenant-Governor Davis,
and two Governor Washburns: to the first of whom
we lived next door in Pearl Street; in the shadow
of the Episcopal Church of which the Rev. Dr. Huntington,
translated afterward to Grace Church
in New York and widely known, was rector.
Later I read law for a year in the office of Governor
Washburn's partner: afterward that Senator Hoar
who in learning and capacity stood second to few
in Washington, and in character to none.
</p>

<p>
Twenty years ago, my mind filled with these
images of almost rural charm, I went back on a
visit to Worcester.  It had grown to be a city of
near one hundred thousand people, and
unrecognizable.  The charm had vanished.  The roar
of traffic was to be heard everywhere; surface
cars raced through the streets; blazing gilt signs
with strange and often foreign names emblazoned
on them in gigantic letters, plastering and half
hiding the fronts of the buildings; mostly new.
It might have been a section of New York&mdash;at
any rate it was given over to the fierce
competition of business.  Of the tranquillity which once
brooded over the town, no trace was left.  I
suppose it all means prosperity, in which I rejoice;
but it was not my Worcester.
</p>

<p>
If it be still, as we used affectionately to call it,
the Heart of the Commonwealth, then I suppose
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
the Commonwealth also has changed; for better
or for worse, according to your point of view.
Boston certainly has changed, and as certainly
for the worse.  Where is the old Boston we all
loved?  What has become of those historic streets
which the great men of more than one great
generation trod?  Where is the dignity, the
quaint, old-fashioned beauty, the stamp of
distinction, the leisureliness of life, the atmosphere
which Winthrop and Endicott, John Hancock
and Otis, Everett and Andrew, once breathed?
The only Boston they knew is to-day a city of
tumult and uproar, amid which the State House
and the Common and the Old South Church and
State Street itself seem anachronisms and untimely
survivals of other and holier days.
</p>

<p>
In the old Worcester&mdash;and, for aught I know,
in the new&mdash;far up on Elm Street as it climbs the
hill and pushes toward the open country, stood
Governor Lincoln's house&mdash;square, white, well
back from the street; a fence enclosing the broad
lawn, steps and an arched iron gateway in the
centre.  To me ever memorable because there
I first saw Daniel Webster.  He had come to
Worcester campaigning for Taylor, whose nomination
for the Presidency, over his own head, he had
at first declared "unfit to be made."  He arrived
in the dusk of evening, and drove in Governor
Lincoln's open landau to the house.  A
multitude waiting to greet him filled the street.
Webster descended from the carriage, went up
the three steps from the sidewalk to the gateway,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
turned, and faced the cheering crowd.  The rays
from the lighted lantern in the centre of the arch
fell full on his face.  I do not remember whether
I thought then, but I have often thought since
of what Emerson said:
</p>

<p>
"If Webster were revealed to me on a dark
night by a flash of lightning, I should be at a loss
to know whether an angel or a demon stood before
me."
</p>

<p>
That night, at any rate, there was a touch of the
demon.  His advocacy of the successful soldier
was an act of renunciation.  The leadership of the
Whig party belonged to him and not to Zachary
Taylor; or if not to Webster, it belonged to Henry
Clay.  He had not forgiven his successful
soldier-rival.  He never forgave him.  Nor could he all
at once put to sleep for another four years his
honourable ambition.  His eyes blazed with a
fire not all celestial.  The grave aspect of the
man and grave courtesy of his greeting to the
people before him only half hid the resentment
which fed their inward fire.  But he stood a
pillar of state&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ... deep on his front engraven<br />
  Deliberation sat and public care.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A colossal figure.  We boys in Massachusetts
were all brought up to worship Webster, and
worship him we did; till the Fall came, and the
seventh of March speech turned reverence into
righteous wrath.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
</p>

<p>
There was a certain likeness in feature between
Mr. Webster and Mr. Gladstone.  The eyes in
both were dark, deep set, and wide apart, beneath
heavily overhanging brows.  In both the flame
was volcanic.  The features in both were chiselled
strongly, the lines clear cut, the contour of the
face and the air of command much the same in
the great American and the great Englishman;
but Mr. Gladstone had, before the political
disasters of his later years had angered him, a
benignity which Webster lacked.  In stature, in
massiveness of frame, in presence, in that power
which springs from repose and from the forces of
reserve, there was no comparison.  Webster had
all this, and Gladstone had not.  I have
before me as I write a private photograph of
Mr. Gladstone, from the camera of a lady who had
something more than technical skill, who had a
sympathetic insight into character and an
art-sense.  Among the hundreds of photographs of the
Tory-Liberal, the Protectionist-Free Trader, the
Imperialist-Home Ruler, this is the finest and truest
I have seen.  But it is one which brings out his
unlikeness to Webster far more clearly than those
resemblances I have noted.  If those resemblances
have not before been remarked, there are, I
imagine, few men living who have seen both men
in the full splendour of their heroic mould.
</p>

<p>
The records of those later days are full not only
of admiring friendship for Webster, but also of
that bitterness which his apostasy&mdash;for so we
thought it&mdash;begot.  Even friends turned against
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
him after his support of the Fugitive Slave Law.
As for his enemies, there was no limit to their
language.  A single unpublished incident will
show what the feeling was.  At a meeting of the
Abolitionists in the Boston Melodeon, Charles
Lenox Remond, a negro, in the course of a diatribe
against the white race, called Washington a
scoundrel.  Wendell Phillips, who was on the
platform, intervened:
</p>

<p>
"No, Charles, don't say that.  Don't call
Washington a scoundrel.  The great Virginian
held slaves, but he was a great Virginian still,
and a great American.  It is not a fit word to use.
It is not descriptive.
</p>

<p>
"Besides, if you call Washington a scoundrel,
how are you going to describe Webster?"
</p>

<p>
Besides, again, the Fugitive Slave Law wrought
the redemption of Massachusetts; and we owe
that redemption to Webster, indirectly.  It was
the rendition of Anthony Burns, in 1854, two
years after Webster's death, which completed
the conversion of the Bay State from the
pro-slavery to the anti-slavery faith.  But what I
can tell of the unwritten history of those black
days must be for another time.
</p>

<p>
Whatever Webster's faults, and whatever
resentment he aroused in 1850, he remained, and
will long remain, the foremost citizen of
Massachusetts in that generation.  Go to his opponents
if you want testimony for that.  Ask Wendell
Phillips, and he answers in one of his finest
sentences, pouring scorn on the men who took up,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
so late as 1861, Webster's mission to crush
anti-slavery agitation:
</p>

<p class="quote">
It was Webster who announced from the steps of the
Revere House that he would put down this agitation.  The
great statesman, discredited and defeated, sleeps at
Marshfield by the solemn waves of the Atlantic.  <i>Contempsi
Catiline gladios; non tuos pertimescam</i>.  The half-omnipotence
of Webster we defied; who heeds this pedlar's
empty speech?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ask Theodore Parker, who delivered in the
Music Hall of Boston a discourse on Webster's
death; half-invective, more than half-panegyric,
whether he would or no.  It was, I think, Parker
who said of him that four American masterpieces
in four different kinds were Webster's.  The
ablest argument ever heard in the Supreme
Court of the United States, that in the Dartmouth
College case, was his.  His was the noblest
platform speech of his time at the dedication of
Bunker Hill Monument.  His the most persuasive
address to an American jury, in the White murder
case at Salem, with its tremendous epigram,
"There is no refuge from confession but suicide;
and suicide is confession."  His, finally, the
profoundest exposition of constitutional law, the
reply to Hayne in the United States Senate.  All
these were Webster's, and to Webster alone could
any such tribute be paid.
</p>

<p>
When I heard Webster in Faneuil Hall, where
he was perhaps at his best and most at home, it
seemed to me it mattered little what he said.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
The authority of the man was what told.  Before
he had uttered a word he had possession of the
minds of the three thousand people who stood&mdash;for
we were all standing&mdash;waiting for the words
we knew would be words of wisdom.
</p>

<p>
Twice I have seen a similar effect by very
different artists.  Once by Rachel at the Boston
Theatre, as Camille in Corneille's <i>Horace</i>, when
the mere apparition of that white-robed figure
and the first rays from those deep-burning eyes
laid a spell on the audience.  Not once, but many
times, by Aimée Declée, at the Princess's Theatre
in London and at the Gymnase in Paris.  Of her
I shall have something to say by and by, but I
name her now because she had that rarest of
gifts, the power of gathering an audience into
her two small hands while still, silent and
motionless; and thereafter never letting them go.  In
her it was perhaps a magnetic force of emotion,
for she was the greatest of emotional actresses.
In Webster it was the domination of an irresistible
personality, with an unmatched intellectual
supremacy, and the prestige of an unequalled career.
</p>

<p>
Whatever it was, we all bowed to it.  We were
there to take orders from him, to think his thoughts,
to do as he would have us.  He might have talked
nonsense.  We should not have thought it was
nonsense.  He might have reversed his policy.
We should have held him consistent.  We should
have followed him, believing the road was the
same we had always travelled together.  He was
still the man whom Massachusetts delighted to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
honour.  The forces of the whole State were at
his disposal, as they had been for thirty years.
</p>

<p>
He stood upon the platform an august, a
majestic figure, from which the blue coat and buff
trousers and the glitter of gilt buttons did not
detract.  Once, and only once, have I found
myself under the sway of an individuality more
masterful than Webster's, much later in life, so
that the test was more decisive; but it was not
Mr. Gladstone's.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
MASSACHUSETTS PURITANISM&mdash;THE YALE CLASS OF 1853
</h3>

<p>
Massachusetts was in those days, that is,
in the middle of the last century, in the
bonds of that inherited and unrelaxing Puritanism
which was her strength and her weakness.  Darwin
had not spoken.  The effort to reconcile science
and theology&mdash;not religion&mdash;had only begun.
Agassiz's was still the voice most trusted, and he,
with all his scientific genius and knowledge, was
on the side of the angels.  The demand for
evidence had not yet overcome the assertion of
ecclesiastical authority in matters of belief.  The
spiritual ascendancy of the New England minister
was little, if at all, impaired, and his political
ascendancy had still to be reckoned with.  There
were, I suppose, no two places in the world so
much under the dominion of one form or another
of priestly rule as the six New England States and
Scotland; and therefore no two between which
spiritual and political resemblances were so close.
</p>

<p>
There were, however, influences which while
less visible were sometimes more potent.  The
pastor was the figurehead of a Congregational
Church; or, to use Phillips's simile, he was the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
walking-beam which the observer might think
the propelling force of the steamboat.  "But,"
said Phillips, "there's always a fanatic down in
the hold, feeding the fires."  The fanatics were
the deacons.  They often had in them the spirit
of persecution.  They encroached upon, and
sometimes usurped, the rightful authority of the true
head of the Church, the pastor, in matters of
faith and matters of conduct alike.  They
constituted themselves the guardians of the morals
of the flock, the pastor and his family included.
My father was a man whose mind ran strongly
toward Liberalism.  He had nothing of the
inquisitor about him.  But his deacons were
possessed with a school-mastering demon.  They
had the vigilance of the detective policeman and
a deep sense of responsibility to their Creator
for the behaviour of their fellow-men.  Good
and conscientious citizens all of them, but
indisposed to believe that men who held other opinions
than theirs might also be good.  Their individual
consciences were to be the guide of life to the rest
of the world.  If they had not the ferocity of
Mucklewraith they had his intolerance.  They
would have made absence from divine service
a statutory offence, as the earlier Puritans did.
Two services each Sunday, a Sunday-school in
between, and prayer-meetings on Wednesdays&mdash;all
these must be punctually attended by us
children, and were.
</p>

<p>
When a decision had to be taken about my
going to college, I wished to be sent to Harvard,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
as every Massachusetts boy naturally would.
But Harvard was a Unitarian college, and the
deacons persuaded my father that the welfare
of my immortal soul would be imperilled if I was
taught Greek and Latin by professors who did
not believe in a Trinitarian God.  This spirit
of theological partisanship prevailed and I was
sent to Yale.  At that admirable seat of learning
there was no danger of laxity or heresy.  The
strictest Presbyterianism was taught relentlessly
and the strictest discipline enforced.  Chapel
morning and evening, three or perhaps four
services on Sunday&mdash;in all let us say some eighteen
separate compulsory attendances on religious
exercises each week.  Would it be wonderful
if a boy who had undergone all this for four
years should consider that he had earned the
right to relaxation in after days?
</p>

<p>
None the less willingly do I acknowledge my
debt to Yale, a debt which would have been
heavier had I been more industrious.  The
President of the University in our time was the
Reverend Dr. Wolseley&mdash;learned, austere, kindly, but
remote.  We boys saw little of him except on a
pedestal or in the pulpit.  When he bade the
class farewell, he made us a friendly little speech
and proposed a toast: "The Class of 1853.  I
drink their healths in water.  May their names
not be writ in water."  Nor were they.  Perhaps
no class contained so many members who have
filled larger spaces for a longer time in the public
eye and the public press.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
</p>

<p>
There was Stedman, the poet and poet critic.
He left poems which will live forever, but no such
body of poetical achievement as he might have
produced had not circumstances obliged him to
devote to business and to editorial work abilities
superior to either.  He is not remembered
pre-eminently as a poet of patriotism, but the only
poem of Stedman's included in Emerson's
Parnassus is his "John Brown of Osawatomie,"
written&mdash;was it not for <i>The Tribune</i>?&mdash;in
November, 1859, while Brown lay in his Virginian jail
waiting to be hanged.  Stedman, his genius
flowering in a prophetic insight, warned them;
but his "Virginians, don't do it" rang unavailingly
through the land; and his
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Old Brown,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osawatomie Brown,<br />
  May trouble you more than ever when you've nailed<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his coffin down<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
never reached the Virginian mind till Northern
regiments sang their way through Southern States
to the tune of "John Brown's Body."  Stedman's
range was wide.  He set perhaps most value on
his <i>Lyrics and Idylls</i>.  That was the title he gave
to the volume of poems published in London in
1879; selected by himself for his English readers.
His American friends will like to be reminded
that the first third of the volume is given to
"American Lyrics and Idylls," including "Old
Brown," and that tender monody on Horace
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
Greeley which no <i>Tribune</i> reader can have
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
There was Charlton Lewis, an Admirable Crichton
in his versatility,&mdash;if the serious meaning of
that name has survived Mr. Barrie's travesty
of it on the stage.  We knew him at Yale as a
mathematician who played with the toughest
problems proposed to us by mathematical tutors
and professors; whose very names I forget.  We
knew him afterward as lawyer, insurance expert,
Latin lexicographer, journalist, financier, and
editor of <i>Harper's Book of Facts</i>, the best of all
books of facts; but now, or when I last inquired,
out of print and not easily procurable.  He
understood cards also.  Playing whist, which I think
was forbidden in college, he dealt to his partner
and two adversaries the usual miscellaneous hand;
and to himself, by way of jest, all thirteen trumps.
When the enemy remonstrated Lewis answered:
"If you will specify any other order in which it
is mathematically more probable that the hands
would be distributed, I will admit that this is
not the product of chance."  An answer to which
there was no answer.  He delighted in puzzling
minds less acute and less scientific than his own.
Few men have had a more serviceable brain than
his, or known better how to use it; and his power
of work knew no limit.
</p>

<p>
There was Mr. Justice Shiras of the United
States Supreme Court.  There was Fred Davies,
a dignitary of the Church&mdash;in whom professional
decorum never extinguished a natural sense of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
fun and good-fellowship.  There was, and happily
still is, Andrew White, historian, writer of books,
President of Cornell University, Ambassador, and,
in a forgetful moment, one of President Cleveland's
commission to determine the boundary line between
a British colony and a foreign state; neither
of whom had asked him to draw it.  There was
Isaac Bromley, one of the world's jesters who make
life amusing to everybody but themselves; whom
all his colleagues on <i>The Tribune</i> valued for
qualities which were his own and not ours.  Not
the least of the many eulogies which death brought
him was the testimony of those who knew him
best, that his humour was good-humoured.
</p>

<p>
The most casual reader must have noticed how
various are the talents and characters among the
hundred and six graduates of 1853.  There are
many more.  There is Wayne MacVeagh, the
most delightful of companions, counsel in great
causes all his life, Attorney-General of the United
States, Ambassador to Rome, one of the men who
paid least respect to social conventionalities, yet
in Washington a central figure in society.  But
neither law nor society gave full scope for the
restless energy of his mind.  During all the later
years I have known MacVeagh he has been a
thinker, serious, daring, too often unsound.  His
reading has been largely among books dealing
with those new social problems which vex the
minds of men, often needlessly, and disturb clear
brains.  Novelties interested him; and the drift
of his thoughts was toward radical reconstruction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
and toward one form or another of socialism.  He
espoused new opinions with vehemence; and
sometimes reverted with vehemence to the old.
We met again in London some five and twenty
years ago.  MacVeagh delivered to a little
company at lunch a brief but reasoned and rather
passionate discourse against our diplomatic service
in Europe.  When I suggested that we had none,
he retorted:
</p>

<p>
"But we have Ministers and Legations and
though some of our Ministers are good and able
men, they are wasted.  No Minister is needed.
All the business of the United States in Europe
could be done and ought to be done by Consuls,
and all the Legations ought to be abolished, and
the Ministers recalled."
</p>

<p>
I forget just how long it was after this outburst
that MacVeagh was appointed Minister to
Constantinople; and accepted and served; with credit
and distinction, and afterward more efficiently
still as Ambassador to Rome.
</p>

<p>
He had a pretty wit in conversation, and a power
of repartee before which many an antagonist
went down.  A celebrated American <i>causeur</i> once
attacked him as a Democrat.  "Yes," answered
MacVeagh, "I am a Democrat and know it.
You are a Democrat and don't know it.  You have
just been made President of a great railroad
corporation.  The stock sells to-day at a hundred
and twenty; but before you have been President
three years, you will have brought it within reach
of the humblest citizen."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
</p>

<p>
An unfulfilled prophecy, but that is what makes
prophecy so useful as an instrument of debate.
Only time can prove it false.
</p>

<p>
These men and many more gave distinction
to the class.  Randall Gibson, of Louisiana,
afterward Confederate General and United States
Senator, cannot be omitted from the briefest
catalogue.  He was one of a small band of
Southerners at Yale.  When you came to know him
you understood what the South means by the
word gentleman; and by its application of the
title to the best of its own people, or to the ruling
class in the South as a whole.  Already, of course,
and even in this younger brood, the clash of
interests and sentiments, the "prologue to the
omen coming on," the strained relations between
South and North, were visible, and vexatious
enough in social intercourse.  Randall Gibson
was saturated with Southern ideas, and perhaps
had the prejudices of his race, but he kept them
to himself or did not impart them to us of the
North.  He lived in the upper air, yet he looked
down on nobody.  There was no more popular
man, yet no man who held himself so completely
aloof from the familiarities common enough as
between classmates.
</p>

<p>
In after life, from the havoc of war and other
causes, he suffered much and bore disaster with
courage.  He was a man with reference to whom
it is possible, and was always possible, to use the
much-abused word chivalrous, with the certainty
it could not be misunderstood.  When he died
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
there passed away a beautiful example of a type
common in literature, rare in life, rarest of all in
this generation, the grand seigneur.
</p>

<p>
There was lately an Englishman, Earl Spencer,
whom Randall Gibson resembled: slightly in
appearance, closely in those essential traits which
go to the making of character.  The same
urbanity; the same considerateness to others; the
same loyalty of nature; the same shining courage;
the same unfailing effort to conform to high
ideals.  Both men had the pride of race and of
descent.  In both it turned to fine effects.  I
have known Lord Spencer to submit&mdash;I may
be forgiven this distant allusion&mdash;to what can
only be called an extortion rather than engage
in a legal controversy he thought undignified, yet
out of which he would have come victorious.  I
have known Randall Gibson to accept the verdict
of fate, the award of undeserved adversity, rather
than defend himself when his success might have
exposed his comrades to censure.  The world
may call it in both of them quixotic, but the world
would be a much better place to live in if quixotry
of this sort were commoner than it is.  Neither
of these two men railed against the world, or
complained of its ethical standard.  All they did
was to have each a standard of his own and to
govern their own lives accordingly.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
YALE PROFESSORS&mdash;HARVARD LAW SCHOOL
</h3>

<p>
The three Yale professors whose names after
all these years stand out most clearly to
me are Thacher, Hadley, and Porter.  Professor
Thacher taught Latin.  They used to say he
knew Tacitus by heart&mdash;perhaps only a boyish
emphasis upon his knowledge of the language
and literature.  He was, at any rate, a good
Latinist, and a good teacher.  What was perhaps
more rare, he was a genial companion, to whom
the distance between professor and pupil was not
impassable.  He won our sympathies because
he gave us his; and our admiration, and almost
our affection, went with our sympathies.  He was
one of the few college dignitaries upon whom the
student feels himself privileged to look back as
a friend; for on his side the spirit of friendly
kindness governed the relations between us.
</p>

<p>
Of Professor Hadley's Hellenism we expressed
our admiration by saying he dreamed in Greek.
To us, so long as we were in his hands, Greek was
the language of the gods.  The modern heresies
touching the place of Greek in a liberal education
had at that time not been heard of, or had taken
no hold upon the minds of either teacher or pupil.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
We learnt Greek, so far as we learnt it, in the same
unquestioning spirit as we read the Bible; so far
as we read it.  Hadley taught us something
more than grammar and prosody.  He taught us
to look at the world through Greek eyes and to
think Greek thoughts.  To him the Greek language
and literature were not dead but alive, and
he sought to make them live again in his pupils.
I don't say that he always succeeded; or often,
but at least we perceived his aim, and we listened
with delight to the roll of Homer's hexameters
from his flexible lips.  For the time being he was
a Greek.  To this illusion his dark eyes and olive
skin and the soft full tones of his voice
contributed.  Some of his enthusiasms, if not much
of his learning, imparted themselves to us.  If
we presently forgot what we learned, the influence
remained.  "I do not ask," said Sainte-Beuve,
"that a man shall know Latin or Greek.  All I
ask is that he shall have known it."  A sentence
in which there is a whole philosophy of education;
a philosophy which the universities that have
abolished Greek out of their compulsory courses
forgot to take into account.
</p>

<p>
Professor Porter's mission was to implant in
our young minds some conception of Moral
Philosophy and of Rhetoric.  He taught
persuasively, sometimes eloquently, and always with
a clearness of thought and purpose which made
him intelligible to the dullest and instructive.
He had another means of appeal to his students.
He was human and sympathetic.  We looked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
upon our professors as, for the most part, beings
far removed from us; exalted by their position
and virtues above us, and above mankind in
general; a sort of demigods who had descended
to earth for the good of its inhabitants, to whom,
however, they were not of kin.  We never thought
that of Professor Porter.  He had a magical
smile; it was the magic of kindness.  We fancied
that the Faculty dealt with the students in a
spirit of strict justice; from their point of view
if not always from ours.  They were a High
Court of Justice which laid down the law and
enforced penalties out of proportion to the offence.
It was law, and the administration of it was
inexorable.  Not so Porter.  He was never a
hanging judge.  I know it because I owed to him the
privilege of remaining at Yale to the end of my
four years.  I have quite forgotten what crime
I committed, but it was one for which, according
to the strict code by which the undergraduates
were governed, expulsion was the proper sentence;
or perhaps only suspension, which in my case
would have meant the same thing.  But Professor
Porter intervened.  There were mitigating
circumstances.  These he pressed upon his
colleagues, and I believe he even made himself
answerable for my good behaviour thereafter.
I stayed on, and if I did not profit as I ought to
have profited by the opportunity I owed to him,
I was at least grateful to him, and still am.
</p>

<p>
Professor Porter became later President of
Yale: one on the roll of Chief Magistrates of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
University to whom not Yale only but the country
is, and for two hundred years has been, indebted.
He ruled wisely, fine administrative qualities
reinforcing his scholarly distinction.  He was
beloved, and his name is for ever a part of the
history of this great college.
</p>

<p>
Looking back on those days and on the
Professors I have known since, at Yale, Harvard,
Columbia, and one or two other American
universities, one thing impresses me beyond all
others.  It is the spirit of devotion in those men;
of devotion to learning, to letters, to their colleges,
and to their country.  Many of them were, and
many in these days are, men who had before them
other and far more profitable careers.  They might
have won much wider fame and made a great
deal more money.  They have been content with
the appreciation of their own world, and with
salaries which, I believe, never exceed six
thousand dollars, and are commonly much less.  When
English critics, albeit in a friendly spirit, have
commented&mdash;in private, not in public&mdash;on the
American love of money-making, I have made
this answer, pointing to the absolute unselfishness
of one of the highest types of American citizen,
all over the land, and to their conception of what
is best in American life.  I have always added
that though others may speak of their renunciation
as a sacrifice, they never do.  So far as I
know them, they are content and more than content;
they rejoice in their work and in the modest
circumstances which alone their income permits.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
Now and then we hear of some brilliant scholar
as having refused a lucrative post in order to
go on teaching and studying.  There are many
more whom we never hear of publicly, to all of
whom the country owes a debt of gratitude if
nothing else, which it does not always pay.  But
here in England if you state the facts you will
find them accepted, and welcomed as the best
answer to the reproach of money-ambitions&mdash;a
reproach based on conspicuous exceptions to the
general American rule of thrift and simplicity.
</p>

<p>
After graduating at Yale, and after a year in
Mr. Hoar's office at Worcester, I went to the
Harvard Law School.  Harvard was as much
a Unitarian university as ever, but perhaps it
was considered that law was a safeguard against
loose theology, or perhaps the old reasons were
no longer omnipotent.  I attempt no comparisons
between Yale and Harvard.  There is no kind
of likeness between undergraduate and
post-graduate life.  During four years at Yale the
discipline had been rigid.  At the Law School
in Cambridge I cannot remember that we were
under any restraint whatever.  In New Haven
we lived either in the college dormitories or in
houses approved by the Faculty; and I am not
sure that in my time we did not all sleep within
the college limits, insanitary and uncomfortable
as many of the buildings then were.  But the
law student in Cambridge lived where he would
and as he would.  He went to chapel or not,
week-days and Sundays alike, to suit himself.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
Not even attendance at the law lectures was
compulsory.  It seems to have been held that students
had come to the school upon serious business,
and that their own interest and the success of
their future careers would be enough to ensure
their presence.  It was not always so.  The very
freedom which ought to have put men on their
honour sometimes became a temptation.  And
Boston was a temptation; as it was, and must
always be, to undergraduates and graduates alike.
</p>

<p>
The years were drawing on&mdash;it was now 1854&mdash;and
the sectional antagonism of which there had
been evidence enough at Yale was increasing.
We were older, and the crisis was nearer.  There
was a kind of Law School Parliament in which
all things were put to the issue of debate, and the
air often grew hot.  Angry words were exchanged
between Southerners and Northerners.  The
rooted belief of the Southerner, or of many
Southerners, that they had a monopoly of courage,
was sometimes expressed.  More than once
challenges were talked of, though I believe none was
actually sent.  There was a choleric young
gentleman from Missouri who put himself forward as
champion of slavery, and there was an attempt
to deny to us of the North the right to express
our opinions on our own soil, which did not
succeed.  The Missourian was the exception.
Of the Southerners in general at Harvard I should
say what I have said of those at Yale: if they
felt themselves of a superior race they accepted
the obligations of superiority, and treated their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
inferiors with an amiable condescension for which
we were not always grateful.
</p>

<p>
These were not matters of which the authorities
of Dane Law School took notice.  Their business
was to teach Law.  Judge Parker was a real
lawyer, who afterwards revised the General
Statutes of Massachusetts into something like
coherence and the symmetry of a Code.  He handled
the law in a scientific spirit, without emphasis,
not without dry humour, and had ever a luminous
method of exposition which grew more luminous
as the subjects grew more abstruse.  His colleague,
Mr. Theophilus Parsons, was, I think, what is
called a case lawyer, to whom the <i>chose jugée</i> was
as sacred as it was more recently to the
anti-Dreyfusards.  There are always, and I suppose
always will be, lawyers to whom decisions are
more than principles.  Parsons was one of these,
while Parker's aim was to present to the student
the entire body of law as a homogeneous whole,
organic, capable of abstract treatment, capable
of being set forth in the dry light of reason.
Whether it was the difference in the men or in
their methods I know not, but there can be no
doubt that Judge Parker's lectures were better
attended and more devoutly listened to by the
students, and that his system bore fruit.  For
it created a habit of mind, and under his teaching
a legal mind was formed, and became a better
instrument for use at the Bar.
</p>

<p>
The Bar of Massachusetts was at that time in a
period of splendour, as it had been for generations.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
Webster was gone, and there was no second
Webster; he was the leader not only of the
Massachusetts Bar but of the American Bar.  But
Rufus Choate was still in his prime, whose
eccentricities of manner and of speech could not
disguise forensic abilities of almost the first order.
Sydney Bartlett, his rival, was as sound as Choate
was showy.  But Choate also was sound, though
he had a spirit of adventure which carried him
too far, and a rhetoric not seldom flamboyant.
Some of his phrases are historical, as of a witness
who sought to palliate his dishonesty by declaring
that he never disclosed his iniquitous scheme.
"A soliloquy of fraud," retorted Choate.  I heard
one of his brethren at the Bar say to him as he
came into court: "I suppose you will give us a
great sensation to-day, Mr. Choate."  "No,"
answered Choate, "it is too great a case for
sensation."  And he tried it all day with sedateness.
Chief Justice Shaw disliked him, or disliked his
methods, and sometimes showed his dislike,
overruling him rather roughly.  The great judge was
not an Apollo, and there came a day when
Mr. Choate, smarting under judicial censure, remarked
in an audible aside to his associate counsel:
"The Chief Justice suggests to me an Indian
idol.  We feel that he is great and we see that
he is ugly."  But amenities like that were unusual.
</p>

<p>
General Butler, afterward too famous at New
Orleans and Fort Fisher, yet after that the
Democratic Governor of Whig Massachusetts, had a
none too savoury renown at the Bar.  Yet it was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
said of him by an opponent: "If you try your
case fairly, Butler will try his side of it fairly;
but if you play tricks he can play more tricks
than you can."  His sense of humour was his
own, sometimes effective and sometimes not.
Defending a railway against an action by a farmer
whose waggon had been run over by a train, and
who alleged that the look-out sign was not, as
required by law, in letters five inches long, Butler
made him admit he had not looked at the sign.
"Then," said Butler to the jury, "it could not
have availed had the sign been in letters of living
light&mdash;five inches long."
</p>

<p>
The best contrast to Butler was Richard H. Dana,
as good a lawyer, or better, and with the
best traditions of a high-minded Bar, pursued
in the best spirit.  But I will leave Dana till I
come to the Burns case.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
  HOW MASSACHUSETTS IN 1854 SURRENDERED THE<br />
  FUGITIVE SLAVE ANTHONY BURNS<br />
</h3>

<p>
It was in May, 1854, that Anthony Burns of
Virginia was arrested in Boston as a fugitive
slave and brought before Judge Loring, United
States Commissioner under the Fugitive Slave
Act of 1850.  I am not going to re-tell the familiar
story of his so-called trial and of the surrender of
Burns to Colonel Suttle, also of Virginia.  The
actual military rank held by Suttle I do not know,
but I call him Colonel on general principles; or on
the principle announced by the late Max O'Rell
in his book on America; with its population of
sixty millions; "<i>la plupart des colonels</i>."  But I
will tell what I saw; and what sort of impression
the event made at the time upon an eye-witness
who belonged to the dominant and most conservative
party in the State; the Whig party.
</p>

<p>
The arrest of Burns made a stir in the old
Commonwealth comparable to none other which
had occurred down to that time.  From Worcester,
where I was then reading more or less law with
Mr. Hoar, I went to Boston to look on at these
proceedings.  I went from no particular feeling
of sympathy with Burns, nor yet mainly from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
abhorrence of that subservience to slaveholders
in which, until after Webster's Seventh of March
speech in 1850, Massachusetts had been steeped.
I went from curiosity.  I wanted to see how
the legal side of it was managed.  For though
the popular dislike of such proceedings, which
neither the Shadrach nor the Sims case had fully
roused, was then slumbering, the State had, so
long ago as 1843, passed a law forbidding any
judge or other officer holding a commission from
the State to take any part in the rendition of any
person claimed as a fugitive slave under the old
Act of Congress of 1793.  Yet here was a
Massachusetts Judge of Probate sitting as United
States Commissioner and doing the work which
in the South itself was done by bloodhounds, and
by the basest of mankind.  I thought I should
like to see how such a man looked while engaged
upon that task; the more so as he bore a good
Massachusetts name; and what kind of a trial
a fugitive slave was to have on Massachusetts
soil.
</p>

<p>
Burns was seized on a Wednesday evening, May
24th.  He appeared before Judge Loring at nine
o'clock Thursday morning, handcuffed, between
two policemen.  It was obviously intended that
the "trial" should begin and end that same
morning.  Burns had been allowed to see nobody.  He
had no counsel.  When Robert Morris, a coloured
lawyer, tried to speak to him the policemen
drove him away.  By chance, Mr. Richard H. Dana,
Jr., and another lawyer of repute,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
Mr. C. M. Ellis, heard of what was going on, and
went to the court-room.  Dana intervened, not as
counsel, for he had no standing as counsel, but
as <i>amicus curiæ</i>, and asked that the hearing be
postponed and that Burns be allowed to consult
friends and counsel.  The black man sat there
"stupefied and terrified," as Dana said, incapable
of thought or action.  After repeated protests by
Dana and Ellis, Judge Loring put off the hearing
till Saturday.  But Burns was still kept in secret
confinement.  When Wendell Phillips asked to
see him to arrange that he should have counsel,
the United States Marshal refused.  Phillips went
to Cambridge to see Judge Loring, and Judge
Loring gave him an order of admission to the cell.
But he said to Phillips&mdash;this Judge-Commissioner
said of the cause he was about to try judicially&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Phillips, the case is so clear that I do not
think you will be justified in placing any obstacle
in the way of this man's going back, <i>as he probably
will!</i>"
</p>

<p>
A remark without precedent or successor in
Massachusetts jurisprudence, which, before and
since, has ever borne an honourable renown for
judicial impartiality.
</p>

<p>
When I went to the Court House on the Saturday
it had become a fortress.  There were United
States Marshals and their deputies, police in
great numbers, and United States Marines.  The
chain had not then been hung about the building
nor had Chief Justice Shaw yet crawled beneath
it.  I was allowed to enter the building, and to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
go upstairs to the corridor on the first floor, out
of which opened the door of the court-room where
Burns was being tried, not for his life, but for
freedom which was more than life.  There I was
stopped.  The police officer at the door would
listen to nothing.  The court-room, free by law
and by custom to all citizens, was closed by order,
as I understood, not of the Commissioner who
was holding his slave-court, but by the United
States Marshal, who was responsible for the
custody of Burns and alarmed by the state of
public opinion.  While I argued with the police,
there came up a smart young officer of United
States Marines.  He asked what it was all about.
I said I was a law student and wished to enter.
"Admit him," said the officer of United States
Marines.  He waited till he saw his order obeyed
and the police stand aside from the door; then
bowed to me and went his way.  So it happened
that it was to an officer of an armed force of the
United States that I was indebted for the privilege
of entering a Massachusetts court-room while a
public trial was going on.
</p>

<p>
Inside they were taking testimony.  Mr. Dana
and Mr. Ellis were now acting as counsel for
Burns, who still seemed "stupefied and terrified."  The
testimony was only interesting because it
concerned the liberty of a human being.  Judge
Loring sat upon the bench with, at last, an anxious
look as if he had begun to realize the storm that
was raging outside, and the revolt of Massachusetts
against this business of slave-catching
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
by Massachusetts judges.  I spoke for a moment
with Mr. Dana and then with one or two of the
anti-slavery leaders who sat listening to the
proceedings.  That sealed my fate.  When I
returned after the adjournment I was again
refused admission, and ordered to leave the Court
House.  When I told the Deputy Marshal I had
as much right there as he had and would take
no orders from him, he threatened me with
arrest.  But of this he presently thought better,
and finding all protest useless, I went away.
</p>

<p>
Of the "trial," therefore, I saw and heard
little.  But of the Faneuil Hall meeting called
to protest against the surrender I saw much,
though not of the sequel to it in Court Square.
Most of the Abolitionist leaders were there, but
the Abolitionists at that time would have been
lost in the great spaces of Faneuil Hall.  The
three thousand men who crowded it were the
"solid men of Boston," who by this time had
begun to think they did not care to see a
Virginian slave-holder crack his whip about their
ears.  The Puritan temper was up.  The spirit
of Otis and Hancock and Sam Adams burned once
more in the hearts of living men.  The cheers
were incessant; cheers for men who a few
days before had been almost outcasts&mdash;far
outside at any rate, the sacred sphere in which the
men of State Street and Beacon Street dwelt.
Theodore Parker, who spoke first from a gallery,
was cheered, and Phillips was cheered.  As the
evening drew on, it was evident that violent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
counsels were likely to prevail.  Already there
had been, all over the city, talk of a rescue.
Parker, ever prone to extreme views, was for it,
and made a speech for which he was indicted
but of course never tried.  The indictment was
but a piece of vindictive annoyance.  But
evidently nothing had been prepared, or, if it had
been, these leaders had not been taken into the
confidence of the men who meant real business.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end some one&mdash;name unknown&mdash;moved
that the meeting adjourn to the Revere
House to groan Suttle.  Parker, who was not
chairman, put the motion and declared it carried,
as beyond doubt it was, and with wild shouts the
vast audience, too closely packed to move quickly,
set their faces to the door and began streaming
slowly out.  Phillips, who was against this plan
and against any violence not efficiently organized,
came forward on the platform.  The few
sentences he uttered have never, I think, been
re
ported or printed, but I can hear them still.
At the first note of that clarion voice the surging
throng stopped and turned.  Said Phillips:
</p>

<p>
"Let us remember where we are and what we
are going to do.  You have said that you will
vindicate the fame of Massachusetts.  Let me
tell you that you will never do it by going to the
Revere House to-night to attempt the impossible
feat of insulting a kidnapper.  The zeal that won't
keep till to-morrow never will free a slave."
</p>

<p>
In that single moment, he had recovered his
control of the audience.  The movement to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
doors had stopped.  Every one waited for what
was coming.  Phillips was at his best.  He was
master of himself and of those before him.  The
words of entreaty were words of command.  He
stood and spoke as one having authority.
</p>

<p>
But just then came a voice from the other end
of the hall.  It belonged to Mr. Charles L. Swift,
the vehement young editor of a weekly paper
called <i>The Commonwealth</i>, and it announced that
a mob of negroes had attacked the Court House,
which had been turned into a gaol, and wanted
help to rescue Burns.  That dissolved the spell.
Faces were again turned to the door.  The shouts
which Phillips had silenced broke loose once more;
and the three thousand citizens of Boston had
become a mob.  It was all to no purpose.  The
hall was long in emptying itself: and long before
those who were really in earnest could reach the
Court House, the ill-advised and ill-planned
attack had been made and failed.  Colonel Higginson,
who, I believe, devised it and led it, had not
at that time any experience in measures of war.
He had plenty of courage of the hot-headed kind&mdash;the
kind not then needed.  Perhaps Alcott who,
after the rush had been made with no success,
marched coolly up the steps leading to the door
defended by armed police and troops, umbrella
in hand, was as much a hero as anybody.  But
it was all over, I gathered in a few minutes, and
the only casualty was the death of a Marshal's
deputy, James Batchelder.  I had got away from
Faneuil Hall as soon as I could, and the distance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
to the Court House is short, but I arrived too
late to see anything but an empty square and
that open doorway with a phalanx of defenders
inside.
</p>

<p>
Burns was not rescued.  He was surrendered,
and no man who saw it ever forgot that shameful
spectacle, nor doubted that it was the rendition
of Anthony Burns which completed the conversion
of the Old Bay State from the pro-slavery to the
anti-slavery faith.  Webster had held the Puritan
conscience in chains for a generation.  It revolted,
no doubt, at the Seventh of March speech; it was
stirred by the Shadrach and Sims cases; but the
final emancipation of the State from its long
thraldom to the slave power coincided with the
surrender of Burns to Suttle.  On that Saturday,
men saw for themselves, and for the first time,
what fugitive slave-hunting in Massachusetts
really meant, and what degree of degradation
it brought.
</p>

<p>
The Court House in chains; the Chief Justice
stooping to pass beneath them; the streets and
squares crowded with State Militia, guarding
the entrance to every street on the route; United
States Marines in hollow square with Burns
and the United States Marshals in the centre;
United States troops preceding and United States
artillery following.  It was fitting that it should
be so.  The State and the United States were
partners in the crime, equal offenders against
the moral law, or against the higher law, which
till then had been the heritage of the Puritan
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
Commonwealth, and had sometimes been heard
of even in Washington.  They shared in the guilt
and shared in the infamy.  Both have since amply
atoned for their sin, but nothing, not even a
Four Years' Civil War for Union and Freedom,
not even the blood of heroes and martyrs, will
ever quite wash out from the memory of those
who saw it the humiliations of that day.  It
blistered and burnt and left a scar for ever.
This procession took its course in broad daylight
down State Street on its way to Long Wharf,
where a United States revenue cutter waited to
embark the kidnapped slave&mdash;kidnapped by
process of law&mdash;and his master, Suttle.  The steps
of the Merchants' Exchange were thronged with
Lawrences and Fays and Lorings who had been
foremost in trying to crush the anti-slavery
agitation.  But when this column drew near,
these friends and servants of the slave-owner
and of the cotton trade suddenly remembered
that they were men before they were merchants;
and men of Massachusetts at that.  They broke
into groans and cries of execration, and the troops
marched past them to the music of hisses and
curses.  All this I saw and heard.  The
re-enslavement of Burns was the liberation of
Massachusetts.  The next time I saw troops in the
streets of Boston was in April, 1861, when the
Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, answering to
the call of President Lincoln, started for
Washington via Baltimore, with results known to the
world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
</p>

<p>
One more incident.  On the Sunday Theodore
Parker preached in the Music Hall, then the
largest hall in Boston, what he called a sermon
on these events.  But Parker's sermons were very
often like those of Cromwell's colonels; you heard
in them the clash of arms, and in this more than
in most.  He never cared deeply about measuring
his words, and he believed in speaking the truth
about men as well as things with extreme plainness.
On this Sunday he was in his finest Old Testament
mood; the messenger of the wrath of the Almighty.
He flung open his Bible with the gesture
of a man who draws a sword, and in tones that
rang like a cry of battle, thundered out his
text:
</p>

<p>
"Exodus xx. 15. 'Thou shalt not steal.'"
</p>

<p>
The text was itself a sermon.  It was the
custom in this Music Hall church to applaud
when you felt like it, or even to hiss.  A deep
murmur, which presently swelled into a roar
of applause, greeted the text.  The face of the
preacher was aflame; so were his words as he told
the story of this awful week and set in the clear
light of truth the acts and words of the
Massachusetts Judge who had brought disgrace upon
Massachusetts.  When he came to the attack
on the Court House, the abortive attempt to
rescue Burns, and the death of the Marshal's
deputy killed at his post, he burst out:
</p>

<p>
"Edward Greely Loring, I charge <i>you</i> with the
murder of James Batchelder.  <i>You</i> fired the shot
that made his wife a widow and his children
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
orphans.  Yours is the guilt.  The penalty a
righteous God will exact for that life he will
demand from you."
</p>

<p>
To say that, he left his pulpit, which was but
a desk on the Music Hall platform, stepped a
little to one side, and stood full in view of the
great company which had gathered to hear him
on this peaceful Sabbath morning; a fair target
for another shot had any hearer been minded to
try one.  You think that a fanciful suggestion?
Then you little know the fierceness of the feelings
which in those days raged in Boston.  They
presently grew fiercer, and reached a climax in
1860 and the early winter of 1861; when men on
both sides for many months went armed, and
were quite ready to use their arms; and when
Phillips and Garrison were in daily peril of their
lives from assassination and, less frequently but
more deadly, from mobs.
</p>

<p>
Among all that devoted band there was no
braver soul than Parker's.  He was by profession
and training a scholar, a theologian, a man of
books and letters, with a rare knowledge of
languages and literature, and the best collection
of German ballads in America; shelves full of
them in his library at the top of his house.  But
by temperament he was a fighter; as befitted the
grandson of that Captain John Parker who
commanded the minute men at Lexington, April
19th, 1775.  He wrote much, preached often and
well, and for twenty years was a great force in
Boston and elsewhere.  A fiery little man, with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
a ruddy face and great dome of a head, spectacles
over his pale blue eyes, the love of God
and of his fellow-men in his heart; and by them
beloved.

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
THE AMERICAN DEFOE, RICHARD HENRY DANA, JR.
</h3>

<p>
Richard Henry Dana, Jr., to whose
intervention in the Burns case we owe it
that Judge Loring was compelled to grant Burns
something in the nature of a trial, was a man whom
Massachusetts may well be content to remember
as one of her representatives for all time.  By
descent, and in himself, he was a chosen son of
that chosen people.  His father, Richard Henry,
his grandfather, Francis, his great-grandfather,
Richard, were all jurists, all patriots, all men of
letters.  Take one step more, and you come to
Daniel, then to Richard again, who, if not quite
a voyager to New England in the <i>Mayflower</i>, is
heard of as a resident in Cambridge in 1640.  Six
Danas&mdash;nay, five, since our Dana survived his
father but three years&mdash;span two centuries and a
half: from father to son as they took their march
down these eventful years, an unbroken line, a
race of gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
It used to be made a reproach to the Dana of
whom I write that he was a gentleman.  Beyond
doubt he deserved the reproach.  When a candidate
for Congress in 1868 in the Essex district
against Ben Butler that eminent warrior called
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
him a kid-gloved aristocrat.  "Not even gloved
has my hand ever touched his," answered Dana in
the heat of a redhot campaign.  Butler's rancour
lasted to the end, as we shall see.
</p>

<p>
This, of course, is no biography of Dana.  I
am writing of what I saw and heard; or not much
more.  I dealt with the Burns case as a record
of personal impressions.  But let me quote as an
example of Dana's method of statement his account
of Burns's arrest.  He said to Judge Loring:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Burns was arrested suddenly, on a false pretence, coming
home at nightfall from his day's work, and hurried into
custody, among strange men, in a strange place, and
suddenly, whether claimed rightfully or claimed wrongfully,
he saw he was claimed as a slave, and his condition burst
upon him in a flood of terror.  This was at night.  You
saw him, sir, the next day, and you remember the state he
was then in.  You remember his stupefied and terrified
condition.  You remember his hesitation, his timid glance
about the room, even when looking in the mild face of
justice.  How little your kind words reassured him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
That is the same hand which wrote <i>Two Years
Before the Mast</i>&mdash;the touch of Defoe, with Defoe's
direct simplicity of method and power of getting
the effect he wanted by the simplest means; the
last word in art, in all arts.  Dana was incapable
of rhetorical extravagance or of insincerity of any
kind.  His <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i> is as much
a classic in England as at home.  One proof of it
is the number of pirated editions, before there was
an international copyright law.  He wrote to me
once: "I hear there is a cheap English edition of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
the book which has had, because of its cheapness,
a great circulation.  Published, I think, in Hull.
Could you send me a copy as a curiosity?"  I
sent it; a little fat volume with a red cloth cover,
much gilt, very closely printed, and sold at a
shilling, long before the days of cheap books.
It had sold by scores of thousands.  It is a
book always in print, in one edition or another.
Copyright profited Dana no more in America
than in England, or not for a long time.  Bryant,
to whom Dana's father sent the manuscript,
hawked it about from one publisher to another
in vain, till finally he sold it outright to Harpers
for two hundred and fifty dollars, copyright and
all.  In my copy, with the imprint of James
R. Osgood &amp; Co., Boston, is a Preface dated 1869,
in which Dana says: "After twenty-eight years
the copyright of this book has reverted to me";
and so he presents the first "author's edition"
to the public.  My copy was a gift from Dana;
it is among the treasures I possess and care for
most, with this inscription in Dana's clear, quiet
handwriting:
</p>


<p class="quote">
My dear Smalley,&mdash;Will you accept this volume from
me and believe me ever truly yours,
</p>

<p class="quote">
RICH'D H. DANA, JR.
</p>

<p class="quote">
<i>Boston, Feb.</i> 17, 1876.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
My real acquaintance with Dana had begun
ten years before, when, in June or July, 1866, we
crossed the Atlantic together in what was then the
crack ship of the Cunard line, the <i>China</i>, the first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
screw that carried the Cunard flag, capable of
fourteen knots.  The Cunarders then sailed from
Boston, touched at Halifax, and thence steamed
to Queenstown direct, and so on to Liverpool.
Halifax was an experience; it took us, with all the
Cunard seamanship, and there was none better,
four hours to get alongside the pier, the currents
running I know not how many miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
The <i>China</i> belonged to the old school; of all
new schools the Cunard people, now foremost
in everything, had at that time an abhorrence.
The saloon aft and tapering to a point, racks over
the table filled with table glass, long benches for
seats, cabins crowded and dimly lighted with one
smoking and smelling oil lamp in a triangular
glass case between two cabins; sanitary
arrangements unspeakable.  I, on my first Atlantic
voyage, thought it all the height of luxury; and
so it was, for that time.  The modern comforts
and splendours of sea life date from 1889 with
the White Star <i>Teutonic</i>, launched in that year,
first of the "floating palaces."  The <i>China</i> made
her way from Halifax to Queenstown through a
continuous fog at undiminished speed.  The
captain, for an exception among the Cunard captains
of those days, regarded a passenger as a human
being, and not merely as a parcel to be safely
carried from port to port and dumped safely on
the wharf, intermediate sufferings of no account.
He would answer a question.  I asked him, with
the audacity of a novice, whether it was safe to
steam day and night through a fog at full speed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Safe, good God, no."
</p>

<p>
"Then why do you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  I will tell you why.  First, we have
got to get to Queenstown and Liverpool.  Second,
fogs don't last for ever, and the faster we go the
sooner we shall get out of this one.  And third,
if there's a collision, the vessel going at the greatest
speed has the best chance."
</p>

<p>
So antedating by many years the famous
saying of another Cunard captain, summoned
to the bridge when a collision seemed imminent,
finding the engines reversed, and instantly ordering
"full speed ahead"; remarking to the first officer
who had reversed the engines: "If there's any
running down to be done on this voyage, I propose
to do it."  But there was none.
</p>

<p>
When I told Dana of my talk with the <i>China's</i>
captain, that experienced seaman and author
of <i>The Seaman's Manual</i> observed: "I like a
captain to have the courage of his opinions, but
not to tell his passengers.  Keep it to yourself."  And
I have kept it for forty years; the captain and
ship are gone to Davy Jones's locker.  Nothing
happened, but something very nearly happened.
There had been no chance of an observation
since leaving Halifax, and we made the Irish
coast rather suddenly, some miles further north
than we expected, came near enough to hear the
breakers, and swung to the south in safety.
</p>

<p>
His mind full of sea lore and of sea romance as
well, Dana was the most delightful of companions
on shipboard.  Beneath an exterior which people
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
thought cold, he had a great kindliness of nature.
He made no professions; his acts spoke for him.
He gave freely of the riches of his mind.  He
knew England and the ways of the English, and
was full of illustrative stories; among them was
one of his first visit to the House of Commons.
</p>

<p class="quote">
I heard that night one of the best speeches to which I
ever listened: fluent, rich in facts, sound in argument; well
phrased and well delivered.  I said to myself, "That man
must carry the House with him."  When he sat down a
member rose on the opposite side and spoke for perhaps ten
minutes.  He stumbled along, hesitated, grew confused,
his sentences without beginning or end; nothing but a
knowledge of the subject and a great sincerity to
recommend him.
</p>

<p class="quote">
But it was perfectly evident that the first speech had no
weight with the House, and that the second convinced
everybody.  The first speaker was Whiteside, a brilliant
Irishman and Solicitor-General; the second a county
member whose name I never knew.  The House thought
Whiteside merely an advocate and his speech forensic.
His opponent was a man whom everybody trusted.  It
was character that carried the day.  And you will find it
generally does with the English.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Dana brought to the study of the law a philosophic
mind, and to the trial of causes in court
a power of lucid exposition invaluable alike with
the Bench and with a jury.  The law was to him
a body of symmetrical doctrine.  He referred
everything to principles, the only real foundation
for anything.  He stood very high at the Bar,
for he had learning and would take immense
pains, and when he brought a case into court it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
was a work of art.  Moreover, he brought a
conscience with it.  And he was one of the
lawyers, none too numerous, to whom even Chief
Justice Shaw listened.  Out of many anecdotes
I have heard from him I will choose one.
</p>

<p>
He had defended in the United States Circuit
Court a man indicted for aiding in the escape of
a fugitive slave.  "The case against him," said
Dana, "was perfectly clear; there was really no
defence; he had beyond a doubt committed the
crime of helping rescue a man from slavery.  I
looked for a conviction as a matter of course.
But after the judge had charged the jury, hour
after hour went by and still they stayed out.
The judge sent for them and asked if they
required any further guidance in law or in fact.
The foreman said 'No'; but they could not agree,
and finally were discharged.
</p>

<p>
"Some years later," said Dana, "as I stood
on the steps of the Parker House, a man came up
to me and said, 'You don't remember me,
Mr. Dana?'  I did not, and he went on:
</p>

<p>
"'Well, Mr. Dana, I expect you remember
trying that case where a man named Tucker was
indicted for aiding and abetting in the escape
of a fugitive slave.  I was on the jury in that
case.'
</p>

<p>
"At this I instantly recalled the facts, and
said: 'Since you were on that jury, I wish you
would tell me what I have always wanted to
know&mdash;why they disagreed.'
</p>

<p>
"'Well, Mr. Dana, I don't mind telling you we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
stood eleven to one for conviction, and that one
obstinate man wouldn't budge.  Perhaps you
remember it was proved on the trial that the
negro was got away from Boston, taken to
Concord, New Hampshire, and there was handed over
to a man who drove him in a sleigh across the
border into Canada.'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, yes, I remember that.'
</p>

<p>
"'Well, Mr. Dana, I was the man who drove
him in the sleigh across the border into Canada.'"
</p>

<p>
I knew something of the preposterous charge
against Dana, that in editing Wheaton's <i>International
Law</i> he had appropriated the labours of a
dull predecessor, Mr. William Beach Lawrence.
When President Grant nominated Dana Minister
to England in succession to that General Schenck
who is still quoted as an authority on poker, the
Lawrence charge was pressed before the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations.  It was an <i>ex
parte</i> hearing, and Dana had no opportunity to
defend himself.  Whether that or the unsleeping
malignity of General Butler did him the more
harm I know not, but President Grant, as his
honourable habit was, stood by his nominee; and
the Senate rejected Dana by thirty-one votes to
seventeen.  The matter naturally attracted
attention in England, and there were comments, none
too just.  I wrote a letter to <i>The Times</i>, of which
Mr. Delane was then editor.  A long letter,
something over a column, but Delane published it
next morning in his best type, first striking out
a number of censorious sentences about Butler
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
and Zach Chandler and other eminent persons
who had engineered Dana's defeat.  In my wish
to do justice to Dana and upon his enemies I had
not remembered that I was writing in an English
newspaper, and had no business to be rebuking
Americans to an English audience.  When I
read my letter and noted Delane's excisions I
saw how wrong I had been, and I wrote to Delane
to thank him for suppressing all those ferocities.
There came in reply such a note as only Delane
would have written.
</p>

<p>
"It is the first time anybody ever thanked me
for using a blue pencil on a correspondent's
letter.  Thank <i>you</i>."
</p>

<p>
This was in 1876.  Dana's letter to me on my
letter about him was characteristic.  I think I
might print it, but it is with other papers in New
York.  He was grateful and kindly, but also
critical.  He was always capable of looking at
his own case as if it were a third person's; his
mind detached from everything that was personal
to himself.  He thought the legal points might
have been pressed.  But the public, especially
the English public, will not have too much law.
I suppose the Beach-Lawrence suit and the
Minister-to-England business troubled Dana more
than anything else in his career.  He ought, of
course, to have been Minister.  He would have
been such a Minister as Charles Francis Adams
was, or as Phelps was, two of the American
Ministers whom the English liked best; out of
the half-dozen who have held in this country a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
pre-eminent position among Ministers and
Ambassadors, including the present Ambassador and
his two immediate predecessors, Hay and Choate.
That brilliant list ought to have been enriched
with Dana's name; but it was not to be.
</p>

<p>
Dana came abroad again in 1878, and I saw
him once more.  He spent his time chiefly in
Paris and Rome, and died in Rome, January 7th,
1882.  He lies near Keats and Shelley in the
Protestant cemetery at Porte Pià; and there is a
monument.  In Boston he is remembered; whether
he is remembered elsewhere I have no means of
knowing.  But we cannot, in whatever part of
America, we cannot afford to forget a man who
had all the American virtues in one of the heroic
ages of America.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
A VISIT TO RALPH WALDO EMERSON
</h3>

<p>
Among the students at Harvard Law School
in 1855 was William Emerson, from Staten
Island, New York, nephew of Ralph Waldo
Emerson.  He asked me one day if I would like
to know his uncle.  I answered that his uncle
was the one man whom I most wished to meet,
and, with a word of surprise at my fervour, he
offered to arrange it.
</p>

<p>
In these days his surprise may not readily be
understood.  Emerson has long since taken his
place among the Immortals.  But at that time
his place was still uncertain.  The number of
his followers was limited; or, as Carlyle said,
fourteen years earlier, "Not the great reading
public, but only the small thinking public have
any questions to ask concerning him."  The
growth of the thinking mind toward Emerson
had, during those fourteen years, been considerable,
but it was still, in Matthew Arnold's phrase, only
the Remnant to whom Emerson was a prophet
or an inspiration.  To the majority he was a
riddle, and there were not a few of the solid men
of Boston who thought him a child of the Devil.
The Whigism of Massachusetts had its religious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
side.  To be a good Whig and one of the elect
you must be an orthodox Unitarian.
</p>

<p>
The days when Unitarianism was to be a
fashionable religion in Boston were still distant.
Emerson was not even a Unitarian; he was an
Emersonian.  He not only thought for himself,
but announced his thought from the housetops;
and to think for oneself was, in those conservative
days, a dangerous pastime.  He came of a race
of preachers on both sides, an academic race, six
generations of them.  For some three years he
was himself a preacher, but presently found he
could no longer administer the Holy Communion
to his congregation, and therefore resumed his
place as a layman.  The platform superseded
the pulpit.  His sermons became lectures and
essays.  He said himself, "My pulpit is the
lyceum platform."  He became a transcendentalist,
as his enemies said, a name he repudiated,
preferring to call the transcendental journal he
edited <i>The Dial</i>.  It was no less an offence to
Boston when Emerson's intellectual independence
led him into the company of the Abolitionists,
though he never wholly identified himself with
that rebellious band.  His first series of Essays
had been published as long ago as 1841, in America,
and in the same year in England with a rather
patronizing Preface by Carlyle.  The second series
appeared in 1840, and the <i>Poems</i> in 1846.
</p>

<p>
In the 'fifties, therefore, Emerson's ideas had
had time to become known to those who liked
them least.  I fell into deep disgrace with a Boston
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
uncle, a lawyer whose office I afterward entered,
first as student and then as practitioner, when
he heard that I had read Emerson.  There was,
moreover, an accomplished young lady who asked
me if it was true that I believed in Emerson, and
then desired to be told what in fact Emerson
believed and taught; one of those appalling
questions which women sometimes put lightheartedly.
I answered as briefly as I could, and she retorted
"I think it perfectly horrid."  And if that
friendship did not come to an end it grew cold, which
I then thought a misfortune, and perhaps still
do.  But society was then intolerant of anything
which menaced its foundations, or was thought
to.  Rightly, I suppose.  Since all societies in
all ages have wished to live, and not die.
</p>

<p>
In the Law School we did not discuss Emerson;
we ignored him.  I can think of no student at
that time who had come under his influence.
They were busy with the law; what was a prophet
to them?  If he had readers they kept their
reading to themselves.  The nephew himself was
more a nephew than a disciple.  He told me I
should find his uncle delightful to know.
Presently, to my delight, he brought me an invitation
to Concord for Saturday to Monday.  We walked
the thirteen miles from Cambridge to Emerson's
home, arriving in the middle of Saturday afternoon.
Photographs have long since made the
house familiar, whether in its original state, or
after the fire in 1872, and the restoration of it
by his fellow townsmen of Concord, and their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
honourable gift of it to him.  A broad gateway
led to it from the road, pine trees standing sentinel
on either side.  Square, with a sloping roof, a
porch in the centre, two windows on either side,
two stories in height; simple almost to bareness,
devoid of architectural pretence, but well
proportioned.  There was, I think, an ell which ran
back from the main building.  Inside, your first
impression was of spaciousness; the hall and rooms
of good size, not very high, and furnished with an
eye mainly to comfort; and an easy staircase.
</p>

<p>
We were taken first into a parlour in the rear of
the library which filled one side of the house.
Emerson's greeting was something more than
courteous&mdash;friendly, with a little element of surprise;
for though he had long been used to pilgrimages
and visits from admiring strangers, to whom
his house was a Mecca, there was, perhaps, a
novelty in the coming of a law student.  A
pleasant light, and a strong light, in his fine blue
eyes, yet they looked at you in an inquiring,
penetrating way as if it was their duty to give
an account of you; impartial but sympathetic.
You could perceive he was predisposed to think
well of people.  I had seen Emerson on the
platform, but there his attitude was Hebraic:
inspired and apostolic.  This was the private
Emerson, the citizen of Concord, and first of all the
host; intent before all things on hospitality.  The
tall, twisted figure bent toward us, the grasp
of the hand was a welcome; the strong face had
in it the sunshine of kindliness; the firm lips
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
relaxing into a smile.  Delicacy went with his
strength, and with the manliness of the man was
blended something I can only call feminine,
because it was exquisite.  Distinction in every line
and tone; a man apart from other men.  Free
from all pretence; of pretence he had no need;
he was absolutely himself, and that was all you
wanted.  There was at first something in his
manner you might call shyness or uncertainty, as
of a nature which might be embarrassed in
unfamiliar company but would go gaily to the stake.
</p>

<p>
I suppose I am collecting the impressions of
this and many later meetings with Emerson, but
I cannot distinguish between them, and it does
not matter.  What was, however, peculiar to this
visit was Emerson's almost anxious sense of his
duties as host; which seemed not duties, but the
inevitable expression of a loving nature.  When
he heard that we had walked from Cambridge he
said we must be tired and hungry and thirsty.  We
were to sit down there and then, we were to eat
and drink.  The philosopher bustled gently about,
seeking wine and food in the cupboards, and
presently putting on the table a decanter of
Madeira and a dish of plum cake.  He was
solicitous that we should partake of both; and
to that end set us the example, saying: "I have
not walked thirteen miles, but I think I can
manage to keep you company at the table."  Then
he bethought himself that he seldom touched
wine; "and indeed I sometimes neither eat nor
drink from breakfast to supper."  He began at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
once with questionings about the law school and
our way of life and study.
</p>

<p>
Then to our rooms, plain, pleasant rooms,
and then tea in the library.  Among the books
he seemed more at home than anywhere else;
they had been his lifelong friends, for whom
he had an affection.  He asked again about
law and the law school.  "A noble study," he
said, "one to which you may well devote a great
part of your life and mind.  As you have chosen
it for your profession I am sure you will master it;
a man must know his trade or he will do nothing.
But law is not everything.  It does not perhaps
make a demand upon all the resources of the
intellect, nor enlarge a man's nature."  Which
was almost a paraphrase of Burke's famous
sentence on the wall in his eulogy on Mr. Grenville:
</p>

<p class="quote">
One of the first and noblest of human sciences; a
science which does more to quicken and invigorate the
understanding than all the other kinds of learning put
together; but it is not apt, except in persons very happily
born, to open and to liberalize the mind exactly in the
same proportion.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then Emerson, who seemed always to be
seeking the final word, and to condense the
whole of his thought into a sentence, added:
</p>

<p>
"Keep your mind open.  Read Plato."
</p>

<p>
Those half-dozen words he uttered in the resonant
tones of the platform; tones which came when
he was deeply stirred and desired to stir his
audience.  They vibrated through the room as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
they vibrated through a great hall; tones which
were meant to find their way, and did find their
way, to the hearts of his hearers; an appeal to
the emotions, to the conscience, to whatever
there was in these thousands, or in the single
individual, sympathetic to the speaker.  I have
never forgotten them.  If I have not followed
Emerson's advice as he meant it, or in full, I have
followed it to a certain extent; desultorily,
inadequately; and certainly with no settled purpose
to become a Platonist, or even an Emersonian.
But it had an effect and the effect has been
permanent.
</p>

<p>
One other great thinker, Pascal, has given the
same counsel; not in words, but by his perpetual
example.  You cannot read Pascal without seeing
that he never states one side of a case, but always
two sides.  Even in matters of faith he keeps an
open mind.  In matters of science it is equally
open; and in all other matters.  To this day, it
is disputed whether Pascal was a believer.  He
himself believed that he was, but he was a pupil
of Montaigne, and Montaigne's motto, "Que
sçais-je?" is inwoven in every sentence of Pascal's
speculations upon matters of faith; and upon all
<i>les choses de l'esprit</i>.  So I put these two influences,
Pascal and Emerson, side by side.
</p>

<p>
If this were the place, a parallel might be
drawn.  The Church, and for good cause, held
Pascal for an enemy; and the Puritanism of New
England, as well as orthodoxy in Old England
and elsewhere, held Emerson for an enemy; also
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
with good cause.  Yet were they two of the most
devout souls of all time.  Why should the churches
of France and of New England array against
themselves the two finest minds of those two
communities, centuries apart?  Pascal's voice
comes softly down the intervening generations&mdash;"Keep
your mind open"&mdash;and Emerson's is the
clear echo of Pascal's, as Pascal's was of
Montaigne.  Emerson, too, sat for a time at the feet
of Montaigne, chose him as one of his "Representative
Men," and said of Montaigne's Essays:
"It seems to me as if I had myself written the
book in some former life."  Pascal had already
said: "Ce n'est pas dans Montaigne mais dans
moi que je trouve tout ce que j'y vois."
</p>

<p>
Emerson had other stimulating suggestions
ready; his talk overflowed with them, yet was
never didactic.  It was as if the suggestions
presented themselves first to him and then to you;
as if he shared his thoughts with you; so far was
he from the method of the pulpit.  Some errand
called him away.  He took down a volume and
put it into my hand, saying: "Some day I hope
you will learn to value this writer.  He has much
to say, and he says it in almost the best English
of his century.  He is a Greek born out of due
time"&mdash;a remark he has somewhere made about
Winckelmann.  It was Landor; a volume of the
<i>Imaginary Conversations</i>.  I read a dialogue there
and then.  I have read him ever since.  I do
not suppose anybody cares what I have read or
not read.  But I wish to give you Emerson's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
opinion; the advice he thought best for a boy
studying law; and the effect of it upon the boy.
</p>

<p>
For he would not talk of what he thought
unsuited to us two, or to me.  In a reminiscence
or two of his tour in England in 1846 or 1847 he
mentioned a visit to Coleridge.  I had read the
<i>Table Talk</i> and the <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, and I
asked Emerson to tell me what he and Coleridge
had discussed.  "No," he said, "it would not
interest you."  In the same way next morning
when he took me to Walden through the woods,
he began upon trees and squirrels and other
forest-lore; then stopped and asked: "But do you know
about trees and animals?  Do they interest you?"  I
had to confess they did not; upon which he began
again on books and matters of literature; and
upon Thoreau.  Of Thoreau he did not seem to
care to say very much.  But he showed me the
lake, and where Thoreau lived, and what he
related of him, though his appreciation was
critical, was touched with the kindness habitual
to him.  I had read the <i>Week on the Concord and
Merrimac Rivers</i>&mdash;or perhaps read it later&mdash;and
<i>Walden</i>, which is thinner, and I had heard, then
or since, that some of Thoreau's admirers accused
Emerson of borrowing from him.  But there was
not much to borrow; nor, for Emerson, anything.
The friendship between the two men was close
and lasted long, but if there were any question
of borrowing or lending in the books of either,
the debt was not on Emerson's side.
</p>

<p>
Now and then as we walked in the forest, or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
through the streets, we met a farmer or other
resident of Concord, and it was pleasant to see
their greetings to their great townsman.  On the
heights he trod no other set foot, but in the daily
business and intercourse of life he was each man's
friend, and each was his.  One of them told me&mdash;it
was Rockwood Hoar, afterward Judge of the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts and United
States Attorney-General&mdash;that half the affairs
of Concord were on Emerson's shoulders.  He
was the chosen adviser, peacemaker, arbitrator
between these hard-headed, practical people of
Concord; the man to whom they went with their
troubles; the man whose decision in difficult
disputes was accepted without demur.  "I don't
suppose," said Mr. Hoar, "that Emerson ever
opened a law book or the Revised Statutes.
But he had a native shrewdness, an eye for the
points of a case, a sense of equity, and a
willingness to take pains which made him an ideal
referee."  I once told an eminent Whig who had
been abusing Emerson as a mere visionary, that
his neighbours, who knew him best, trusted him
in this way.  "They are welcome to him,"
growled the eminent Whig.
</p>

<p>
He also was welcome to them.  He was the
possession and pride of Concord; beloved by the
people among whom he lived his life.  I suppose
his lines about the embattled farmers who fired
the shot heard round the world, are better known
and have thrilled more hearts than any others
he ever wrote.  They seemed to be always on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
Concord lips.  Yes, but Emerson himself had
fired another shot heard round the world; or round
so much of it as speaks the English, or
Anglo-American, tongue.  So when misfortune befell
him and his house was half burnt, and his health
failed, they besought him to go abroad for rest;
and while he was gone they rebuilt his house for
him in the exact similitude of the old.  He was
gone a year, all but two months, with his daughter
Ellen, the true child of her father and his most
faithful and helpful friend.  When Emerson
returned, Concord turned out to greet him, built
a triumphal arch beneath which he had, perhaps
reluctantly, to pass; and so reinstalled him in his
old-new home.
</p>

<p>
This, of course, was long after the time of which
I am writing; in 1872-3.  But when he came to
England, he knew that his friends in Concord were
rebuilding his house.  He could not speak of it
without emotion.  His state of health was such
that emotion was hurtful to him, and his daughter
used to ask us not to refer to the house.  But
whether we did or not, Emerson brooded over it,
and was better and happier in the thought of his
friends' friendship for him.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
  EMERSON IN ENGLAND&mdash;ENGLISH TRAITS&mdash;EMERSON<br />
  AND MATTHEW ARNOLD<br />
</h3>

<p>
Emerson's last visit to England was made
in 1873, after his health had failed.  He had
been in Egypt and on the Continent, hoping to
recover the freshness of his mental powers; but
that was not to be.  In London he and his daughter
Ellen, who gave to her father a loving devotion
without limits, lived in apartments in Down
Street, Piccadilly.  It was only too evident that,
even after ten months of rest and travel, he was
an invalid in mind.  He could not recollect names&mdash;a
failing common in advanced age, of course,
but Emerson was only in his seventieth year
and was to live ten years more.  He resorted to
all kinds of paraphrases and circumlocutions.
"One of the men who seemed to me the most
sincere and clear-minded I have met was&mdash;you
know whom I mean, I met him at your house, the
biologist, the champion of Darwin&mdash;with what
lucid energy he talked to us."  When I mentioned
Huxley's name, Emerson said, "Yes, how could
I forget him?"  But presently the name had to
be given to him again.  The power of association
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
between people or things and the names of them
had been lost.  He was always, said the critics,
a little <i>déconsu</i>; sentences, they insisted,
succeeded each other without much obvious
connection, or without the copula which would have
brought them into their true relation.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, he gave his reader credit for a
little imaginative power.  He took him into
partnership.  He was mindful of Voltaire's pungent
epigram: "<i>L'art d'être ennuyeux, c'est l'art
de tout, dire</i>."  He had his own theory of
style and of diction.  His temperament left him
no choice.  If his quickness of transition from
one subject to another, or from one thought to
another, left some of his readers toiling after him
in vain, they were not the readers for whom he
wrote.  Why should they read him if he wrote
a language to them unknown?
</p>

<p>
The interview between Huxley and himself
to which Emerson referred was at breakfast; for
breakfasts were then given almost as often as
luncheons are now.  There were a dozen or so
people to meet him; men and women.  I
introduced each of them as they arrived.  In each
case they had been asked to make Emerson's
acquaintance, but to some of them Emerson was
an unknown name; or, if not wholly unknown,
called up in their minds no clear image of the man
or knowledge of his life's work.  "Tell me who
he is."  "Tell me what he has done."  "Is he
English or American?"  But I suppose there
never has been a time when a knowledge of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
literature, or of great spiritual influences, has been an
indispensable passport to social position.  Nor
was it because Emerson was an American that
he was unfamiliar to these delightful and, in
many ways, accomplished women.
</p>

<p>
Years afterward, in 1888, I was engaged to
lunch on the day when news of Matthew Arnold's
death had come.  Arnold had been so good a
friend to me that I did not like going on this
first moment to such an entertainment, but I
thought the talk would turn on Arnold, and I
went.  My hostess was a woman renowned in
the world, or in her world, for great qualities,
known to everybody, and I should have thought
knowing everybody who had, as Arnold had, a
place both in letters and in society.  I referred
to his sudden death.  "Ah, yes," she answered,
"an American, was he not?"  That may be set
off against the unacquaintance of these other
ladies with Emerson.
</p>

<p>
What Emerson cared for was to meet the men
and women who stood in some spiritual or
intellectual relation to him; or who were his disciples.
Mr. Alexander Ireland, in his biographical sketch
of Emerson, quotes an illustrative story.  It was
in Edinburgh, this same year, and Dr. William
Smith, President of the Edinburgh Philosophical
Association, was driving him about that wonderful
city.  Dr. Smith had told him of "a worthy
tradesman in Nicholas Street who is his enthusiastic
admirer."  When Emerson heard of it, he
proposed to call on him.  They stopped at the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
"worthy tradesman's," and Dr. Smith went into
the shop and said: "Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, Mr. Emerson is
at the door and will be glad to see you for a few
minutes."  "The five minutes were well spent,"
adds Dr. Smith; and the disciple was happy
for the rest of his life.  It was characteristic of
Emerson, and of Emerson as an American.  Very
likely he did not quite understand how immense
is the gulf which in this country separates the
man who stands behind a counter from the man
who stands in front of the counter.  If he had
understood, he would not have cared.  What he
cared for was the point of contact, and of
discipleship.  It was the master who sought his
pupil, because he was his pupil.
</p>

<p>
During Emerson's too brief stay in London I
called often in Down Street.  Miss Ellen was
anxious to protect her father against the pressure
from many quarters for public addresses, and to
decline as many private invitations as possible.
At Oxford it was the same, but neither in Oxford
nor London did Emerson lecture except briefly
at Mr. Thomas Hughes's Working-men's College.
Between him and Tom Hughes&mdash;he was never
called anything else&mdash;there was not very much
in common except sterling qualities of character.
Hughes was a good and amiable Philistine, English
to the tips of his fingers, who wrote one book,
<i>Tom Brown's Schooldays</i>, which is immortal, and
half a dozen others that are dead or were never
really alive.  But Hughes was one of our friends
in the black days when we had few in England,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
working-men excepted; and Emerson was too
good a patriot to forget that; and too much a
lover of manliness in men not to like one who
had that supreme trait in a high degree, as Hughes
had.  So he made the exception in his favour, for
the Working-men's College was an institution of
high usefulness, in which Hughes's heart was
bound up.  As for society, Emerson was an
invalid, and able on that ground to decline
invitations without offence.  He had studied English
society, as one form of English life, when here
in 1848; and was content with that experience.
"I do not care for classes," he said.
</p>

<p>
The nineteenth century produced two supremely
good books on American and on English civilization:
Tocqueville's <i>De la Démocratic en Amérique</i>
and Emerson's <i>English Traits</i>, published in 1856.
Tocqueville's book, published in 1835, remains
the best book on the United States for the student
who cares to get down to the foundation of things;
who cares more for ideas, tendencies, and
principles than for details.  Of Emerson's the same
thing may be said, yet no two treatises could be
more unlike than those of the Frenchman and
the American.
</p>

<p>
But all I wish now to point out is the effect
of <i>English Traits</i> upon the English themselves.
Roughly speaking, it puzzled them.  It is one
of the truest books ever written.  Yet to the
English themselves its truth has never appeared
quite true.  On Emerson, as thinker, poet,
philosopher, all kinds of judgments have been formed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
in England, and expressed, in some cases, with
vehemence.  He has always had an audience
and a following here; and always enemies.  But
the book they least understand is the book about
themselves.  Looking into the egregious Allibone
for an apt quotation concerning the <i>Traits</i>
I find none, but instead a remark by Allibone
himself that "Mr. Emerson's writings have
excited considerable interest on both sides of the
Atlantic!"  The space given to Emerson in the
<i>Dictionary of English Literature</i> is less than a
column, though fourteen columns are not thought
too many for Longfellow; nor are they.  In the
Supplement Emerson gets a little more attention;
still grudgingly given.
</p>

<p>
Allibone does not matter, and the perplexity
of the Philistine struggling with a book he cannot
understand does not matter.  But let us go at
once to the best of English critics; to Matthew
Arnold.  Alas! we fare no better.  Arnold's
Discourse on Emerson has been resented by
Emersonians as an elaborate disparagement of their
Master.  It is not that.  Arnold was incapable
of disparagement, and while he denies to Emerson
many gifts which his readers find in him, his
appreciation is still sympathetic, and he lifts
himself to own from time to time Emerson's
real greatness.  He thinks the <i>Essays</i> "the most
important work done in prose in our language"
during the last century&mdash;"more important than
Carlyle's."  But he puts aside the <i>English Traits</i>
because, compared with Montaigne, La Bruyère,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
Addison (!), the <i>Traits</i> will not stand the
comparison.
</p>

<p>
"Emerson's observation has not the disinterested
quality of the observation of these masters.
It is the observation of a man systematically
benevolent, as Hawthorne's observation in <i>Our
Old Home</i> is the work of a man chagrined."
</p>

<p>
And Arnold explains that Emerson's systematic
benevolence comes from his persistent optimism.
The book is too good-natured to be scientific.
Yet, oddly enough&mdash;or perhaps not oddly&mdash;the
criticism of the English Philistine is the exact
opposite of Arnold's.  The man in the street, if
he has read the <i>English Traits</i>, complains that
the criticism of things English is too relentless;
that Emerson always has the scalpel and the
probe in hand; that the inquiry is not critical but
anatomical; and the atmosphere that of the
dissecting room.  He is appalled when he sees
the most cherished beliefs of centuries and blended
races put under the microscope, and when
Character, Aristocracy, Plutocracy, the Church,
Religion itself are made to take off their masks and
yield up their secrets.  They are not conciliated
even when Emerson sums up the English as "the
best of actual races."  What care they for
comparisons with other races, or for the opinion of
other races, or of transatlantic critics upon England
and the English and the institutions of this little
island?  Emerson's criticism is chemical, it
resolves things into their elements, their primordial
atoms.  No doubt, but neither the Throne nor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
the Church is shaken, nor a single Act of Parliament
repealed.
</p>

<p>
Arnold, recalling the influences which wrought
upon him as a student at Oxford "amid the last
enchantments of the Middle Ages," said to an
American audience in Emerson's "own delightful
town," Boston:
</p>

<p>
"He was your Newman, your man of soul and
genius visible to you in the flesh, speaking to
your bodily ears, a present object for your heart
and imagination.  That is surely the most potent
of all influences!  Nothing can come up to it."
</p>

<p>
And that is the influence which descended
beneficially upon us of a past or passing generation,
to whom it was given to see Emerson and to hear
him.  As I think it all over, I begin to doubt
whether to have heard Emerson on the platform
did not bring you a sense of greater intimacy
than to have known him even in his Concord
home.
</p>

<p>
There was a time, during Theodore Parker's
illness and absence, when Emerson and Wendell
Phillips used to take his place at stated
intervals&mdash;in both cases, I think, once a month.  Before
the great audience of the Music Hall, Emerson
had precisely the same manner as with a few
hundred people.  He hardly seemed to be aware
of his audience.  He stood there behind Parker's
desk, towering above it, his slight figure adjusting
itself to whatever attitude suited his mood for
the moment; never quite erect; the body never
quite straight; the hands fumbling with his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
manuscript; turning over a dozen leaves at a time;
turning back again another dozen, as if it scarce
mattered in what order he read.  Often he skipped;
the large quarto pages were turned by the score
and there was no return.  His mind seemed to be
carrying on processes of thought quite independent
of those he had inscribed on his manuscript.  He
felt his way with his hearers; and his unconsciousness
of their presence was therefore apparent
only.  Between them and him there was the flow
of invisible, mysterious currents, whether of
sympathy or antipathy.  In Mr. Gladstone's fine
image, they gave back to him in vapour what he
poured out in a flood upon them.  But that, of
course, was far more completely true of an orator
like Mr. Gladstone than of a lecturer like Emerson
who read his discourse.  But it was true in a
measure of Emerson also.
</p>

<p>
But Emerson was an orator too.  He was not
always above the arts of the orator.  He could,
and did, calculate his effects; observing the while
whether they told or not.  He delighted in a
crescendo.  His voice rose and fell and rose again;
and he had unsuspected depths of resonant tone.
At one moment clear and cold, then vibrating
with emotion, in which the whole force of the
man seemed to seek expression; then sometimes
at the very end becoming prophetic, appealing,
menacing; till the sentences came as if from the
Judgment seat.  He once read Allingham's poem,
"The Talisman," as the peroration of his address
in the Music Hall.  I never heard anything like
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
it&mdash;like the wild, strange melody of his voice,
which had in it the intonations and cadences
which give to many Slavic airs, and most of all
to the Hungarian Czardas, though that is dance
music, a magic charm.
</p>

<p>
I have spoken of the prejudice against Emerson
which prevailed in Boston and elsewhere.  It
was most vehement in society.  That worshipful
company, which is necessarily a minority and
prides itself on being a minority, likes to set its
own standards and expects the rest of the world,
so far as it comes in contact with these social
law-givers, to conform to these standards.  They
soon became aware that to no standard but his
own did Emerson ever conform; save so far as
civility and kindness bade him.  He gave way
readily enough in little things.  It is a sign of
greatness to hold little things of little account; an
aphorism by no means universally accepted.
</p>

<p>
However, it was not Emerson's manners to
which society objected, or could ever object.
He had the manners of a king, without the
demands of a king.  He was a republican king.  He
stood for equality, in the sense that he looked
down on no man.  The society view is different.
Society exists in order to look down on all who are
not within its sacred circle.  They must be
inferior because they are outside.  But its objection
to Emerson lay deeper.  It recognized in him
the natural enemy of privilege and prerogative.
There were distinguished members of this
distinguished body who regarded a man who took
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
the liberty of examining the substructure on
which all societies are built as an anarchist.
They were afraid of him.  They thought it safer
to exclude him.  By and by, they compromised.
Is not, or was not, Boston the Home of Culture?
So, as Emerson's fame grew, the exclusion policy
was seen to be feeble.  But when the closed doors
were opened, what was the astonishment of these
excellent persons to discover that Emerson did
not seem to care whether they were open or
closed.  He had his own life to live, and lived it,
serenely aloof.
</p>

<p>
Nothing dies so hard as a prejudice.  I have
one of my own which lives in spite of my affection
for Emerson, and my many debts to him, and
my gratitude that he gave me a little of his
friendship.  I mean that on a too young mind he had,
or might have, an influence not entirely for good.
He set his ideals so high that, as you looked up
to him and them, your feet sometimes went astray,
or stumbled.  He taught you, though he may
not have meant it, to underrate precision of
knowledge, and the value of details.  When the
things of the spirit and the spiritual life mattered
so much, how could it be worth while to know all
the tenses of Greek verbs or to be aware of the
rudiments of toe in the palæontological horse?
There are sentences and pages in <i>The Conduct of
Life</i> and elsewhere which refute this view, and I
do not press it.  But I know the effect, not of
this or that essay, but of Emerson's attitude
toward education, and his philosophic indifference
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
to all but what is highest in thought.  And I
think even to-day I would not put his books into
the hands of a boy who had not settled views
about learning, and a conviction of the invincible
necessity of an accurate method.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
A GROUP OF BOSTON LAWYERS&mdash;MR. OLNEY AND VENEZUELA
</h3>

<p>
A name still remembered in Massachusetts is
that of Judge Thomas of the Supreme
Court, the court of highest jurisdiction in that
State, and one of the few State courts whose
decisions have always been cited with respect in
the Supreme Court of the United States.  It was
recruited largely from the Suffolk Bar.  The
Boston Bar was known as the Suffolk Bar, the
name of the county.  But, of course, other parts
of the State supplied judges, and Worcester
County was one.  Judge Thomas lived and practised
law in the town of Worcester.  He practised
politics also, of a very energetic kind, being a
good platform speaker and a good organizer.
There used to be a story that one morning, in
the heat of an exciting campaign, Thomas knelt
at family prayers and began his invocation to
the Almighty: "Fellow-citizens and Whigs of
Worcester County."
</p>

<p>
However that may be, he was a successful
lawyer, a successful judge, and had attractive
qualities not always to be found at the Bar.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
will tell you in a moment in what way he connects
himself permanently with national and
international history.  I came to know about it
because it was before Judge Thomas that I tried,
at <i>nisi prius</i>, and lost, my first case in the Supreme
Court.  When the jury had delivered their
wrongful verdict, and been sent about their business,
Judge Thomas called me up and spoke to me with
a kindness I have never forgotten.  He thought
I had tried my case well, told me I should do well
at the Bar, and offered, very generously, to help
me if he could.  After a time he resigned his seat
on the Bench and went into practice in Boston.
A little later I called on him and asked whether
he had room for a junior in his office.  "There
would have been room if you had applied earlier,"
said Judge Thomas.  "But I have just been
told by my daughter that she has engaged herself
to a young lawyer, and he is to have the place I
should otherwise have been glad to offer you."
</p>

<p>
The name of that young lawyer was Richard
Olney.  It fell to my lot to see something of him
in Washington forty years later, when he was
Secretary of State under President Cleveland.
I saw him for some weeks, during the height of
the Venezuela crisis, almost daily.  Whether I
shall ever be allowed to tell the whole story of
what went on during those weeks I do not know.
If I were Mr. Olney I would give my assent to
the publishing of a complete statement.  I say
that because, in my judgment, we owe it to
Mr. Olney&mdash;and among Americans to him
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
only&mdash;that a way out of the difficulty in which President
Cleveland's Message had landed us was ultimately
found.  I know how it was found, and except
Mr. Olney himself, I don't think any other
American knows.  I am aware of the explanations
which Mr. Cleveland published in <i>The Century
Magazine</i>, and I think them models of unintentional
disingenuousness.  Moreover, I had means
of knowing what was said and done on this side,
in England, in the Foreign Office and elsewhere,
during those dangerous weeks; and I know why
the settlement was postponed till next summer,
when the American people, at white heat during
December, 1895, and January, 1896, had cooled
off and forgotten there was any crisis at all.
</p>

<p>
But if I never had a chance of saying more,
I wish to say now that Mr. Olney did a great
service to his country, and to both countries; one
of the greatest ever done by any man in his
position, or in almost any position.  I think
Mr. Cleveland became aware that he had acted rashly
and with no full knowledge of the history of that
boundary-line between British Guiana and Venezuela
which he announced to the world his intention
to re-draw to suit himself, with menace of
war to Great Britain.  I don't forget Mr. Olney's
share in the dispatch of July, 1895, which began
the trouble.  He and Mr. Cleveland concocted
that extraordinary document between them at
Gray Gables.  I suppose he knew also of
Mr. Cleveland's Message to Congress, December 12th,
and perhaps approved of it&mdash;indeed, he must
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
have approved of it or resigned.  He must also
have been responsible for the second dispatch
calling upon Lord Salisbury to send an answer
to the July dispatch before the meeting of Congress
in December; a demand perhaps unprecedented as
between two Powers of the first rank.  I know,
too, that some of Mr. Olney's language gave
offence.  Lord Salisbury thought him rude; an
impression due mainly to the different uses made
of the English language in Washington and in
London, and to the non-existence in Washington,
at that time, of that diplomatic freemasonry, in
both speech and act, and of those diplomatic
conventionalities which prevail in other important
capitals of the world.
</p>

<p>
All that&mdash;and there is more&mdash;only emphasizes
the delicacy with which Mr. Olney subsequently
handled the dispute which Mr. Cleveland had
envenomed.  A new period in the negotiations
began.  I shall venture to say, even though
Mr. Olney, out of loyalty to his President might refuse
to admit it, that with the New Year of 1896 the
conduct of the negotiations passed into his hands.
That he reported to the President what was going
on I don't doubt.  But a new spirit prevailed.
The tone which had been so offensive in the
original dispatch, and still more in the Message
to Congress, was dropped.  Mr. Olney had
a wonderful flexibility of mind.  When he saw
that one set of tactics had failed, he was quick
to try another, and not only to try another but
to recognize the need of a wholly new departure.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
He was equally quick in invention, in devising
expedients, in looking at facts with a fresh pair
of eyes.  A trained diplomatist he was not, but
in this emergency he showed the qualities of a
trained diplomatist; the resource, the tact, the
fertility, and the power of divining what was in
his adversary's mind.
</p>

<p>
Lord Salisbury's was not an easy mind to
divine.  He had the gift of silence, and to a still
more remarkable degree the gift of enveloping
his thought in that language of diplomacy which,
as I said, was not at that time a language very
well understood in America.  But Mr. Olney
guessed pretty accurately at Lord Salisbury's
purpose, and they carried on their exchange of
views without very great friction.  The truth is,
both were bent on finding a solution.  The point
in which Lord Salisbury had the advantage was
patience.  Mr. Olney was under some pressure.
Lord Salisbury was not.  Americans will, I think,
do well to bear in mind that, after Prince
Bismarck's death, Lord Salisbury was regarded
throughout Europe as a higher authority, with
a more commanding influence, than any Foreign
Minister then in power.  He had immense
experience, immense knowledge, an immense power
of work, and fine natural gifts perfected by long
practice.  There were not many Ministers who
transacted great affairs with Lord Salisbury on
even terms.  But Mr. Olney was one of them.
</p>

<p>
I find myself, however, going further than I
meant to.  I meant no more than to put on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
record, before it is too late, the testimony of an
eye-witness, and my belief that, but for
Mr. Olney, there might have been a very different
ending to the quarrel upon which President
Cleveland entered in his over-confident, clumsy
way.  I have departed from the order of time
in these "Memories."  I must often depart
from it; I cannot begin a story and leave it half
told because the end belongs to later years.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Olney has made so great a name and place
for himself at the Bar, as well as in the State
Department, that no testimony or tribute can
be of much importance to him.  But it is
important to me to offer it.  A debt of gratitude
may be easily borne, often much too easily;
but if it can never be repaid it can be
acknowledged, and I acknowledge mine to Mr. Olney at
the same time that I remind others of what they
also owe him.
</p>

<p>
I do not regret having had to give way to
Mr. Olney in Judge Thomas's office.  If I had been
admitted into that coveted place, I should have
stayed in Boston and at the Bar, and perhaps
have had a prosperous professional life.  But I
should not have had the kind of experience
which has made life interesting to me in so many
various ways, and which I am now trying to make
interesting to others.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rockwood Hoar, afterward Attorney-General
of the United States, whose name I have
mentioned earlier, was counsel for the other side
in my Supreme Court case.  If my client had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
had a good defence, which perhaps he had not,
a novice at the Bar had little chance against a
man with the learning and force of Mr. Hoar.
He had, however, a spirit of scrupulous fairness.
No man ever suspected Rockwood Hoar of
unworthy devices.  He was too able to need them
and too honest to use them.  But he tried
experiments, as every lawyer does.  He put a
question to a witness which I thought innocent
enough, but a friendly lawyer who sat near called
to me in a stage whisper, "Object."  So I
objected, not the least knowing why.  The judge
looked to Mr. Hoar.  "Surely," said Mr. Hoar,
"my friend will not press his objection."  Not
knowing what else to say, I said I would withdraw
the objection if Mr. Hoar would say he thought
the question competent.  The judge smiled, and
Mr. Hoar smiled at my ingenuousness, and said,
"Well, I will ask the witness another question."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Horace Gray was at that time reporter
to the Supreme Court of Massachusetts.  After
he had become a judge of the Supreme Court of
the United States I used to meet him in
Washington.  One day he said to me:
</p>

<p>
"You used to practise law in Boston."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I think we must have met.  I must have seen
you in court.  You tried a case in the Supreme
Court before Judge Thomas.  Stop a moment.
I can tell you the name of the case.  You argued
it afterward before the full bench.  It was Krebs
<i>v.</i> Oliver."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
</p>

<p>
And it was.  Forty years had passed.  Mr. Justice
Gray had what may be called a memory.
He had much else: an inexhaustible knowledge of
case law; a power of dealing readily with complex
matters; a fast hold of principles; an industry
without limit; the cordial respect of his fellow
judges; and a pleasant house in Washington
whereof the hostess was one of Washington's
favourites.  And he had a stature of somewhere
between six and seven feet, with a smiling face
and massive head to crown this huge frame.  He
is gone.  I wish he were not.
</p>

<p>
Of the many members of this brilliant Suffolk
Bar there was one of a very unusual kind of
brilliancy.  The brilliancy of invariable success
was his.  I believe it to be literally true that
during many years he never lost a case which
depended on the verdict of a jury.  At the Bar,
of course, as elsewhere, nothing succeeds like
success, and Mr. Durant's practice was very
large.  I have noticed that clients, as a rule,
would rather win their cases than lose them.
How did he do it?  Nobody ever knew.  His
beaten rivals, or perhaps their clients, sometimes
hinted at things nobody ever ventured to assert,
since there was not a scintilla of evidence to
justify insinuations.
</p>

<p>
There was probably no secret save what lay
on the surface.  Mr. Durant was a good lawyer
who prepared his cases with a thoroughness that
left no point in doubt, and no scrap of evidence
unexamined.  He knew to a nicety what would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
tell with a jury and what would not.  He was
not a man on whom it was possible to spring a
surprise.  His cross-examinations, without being
showy, were deadly.  As a speaker&mdash;orator he was
not&mdash;he had no other conspicuous merit than
clearness; the art of marshalling facts to fit his
own theory of the case.  When he rose the jury
were predisposed to believe.
</p>

<p>
He had a way of turning to the jury whenever
during the trial he had made a point, brought
out a telling fact, or wrung an admission from an
incautious witness.  It was as if from the
beginning he took the jury into partnership; it was
a matter in which he and they were alike
interested, and the only interest of either was to
discover the truth.  They said of him what was
said by a juryman of another famous advocate:
"It's no credit to him to win his causes.  He
is always on the right side."  When Mr. Durant
sat down the jury were convinced that he, too,
was on the right side, and their verdict was but
the formal and legal ratification of the moral
view, and, as they believed, of their own
conscientious conviction.
</p>

<p>
Hypnotism?  I think not.  The thing was not
much heard of in those days.  It is quite possible
that Mr. Durant used discrimination and never
took a cause into court in which he did not feel
sure of a verdict, but many a lawyer is sure of a
verdict he does not get.  There remains a
residuum of mystery which has never been explained,
and is probably inexplicable.  Mr. Durant's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
presence explained something.  He had a powerful
head, chiselled features, black hair, which he
wore rather long, an olive complexion, and eyes
which flashed the lightnings of wrath and scorn
and irony; then suddenly the soft rays of sweetness
and persuasion for the jury.  He looked like an
actor.  He was an actor.  He understood dramatic
values, and there was no art of the stage he did
not employ upon a hostile or unwilling witness.
He could coax, intimidate, terrify; and his
questions cut like knives.
</p>

<p>
He had a stage name, like so many other actors.
His real name was Smith, which perhaps was not
generally known.  But one day in court he was
tormenting a reluctant witness who had been
Jones and was now Robinson.  "Mr. Jones,"
cried Durant&mdash;"I beg your pardon, Mr. Robinson."  "Yes,
Mr. Smith," retorted the witness&mdash;"I
beg your pardon, Mr. Durant."  That
cross-examination came quickly to an end.  But I
believe Mr. Durant's prestige continued while
he remained at the Bar; then having amassed
a fortune, he abandoned the law and took to
preaching.  Whether he had the same success in
saving souls as in winning causes I never heard.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
WENDELL PHILLIPS
</h3>

<p>
It was in the winter of 1860-61 that the
Massachusetts allies of the Southern Slave Power
made their last effort.  Spite of Webster's death,
with whom died the brains of the party and its
vital force, these men were still powerful in
Boston.  The surrender of Anthony Burns in
May, 1854, the birth of the Republican Party
at Worcester in July of the same year, the
election of Mr. Henry Wilson as Governor, the
cowardly assault in the United States Senate on
Charles Sumner by Mr. Preston Brooks, of
South Carolina, in 1856&mdash;these events had indeed
stirred the people of Massachusetts into revolt
against the Slave Party in this Free State.
</p>

<p>
But there had come a lull.  There were still
hopes that a conflict between North and South
might be averted and that politics might do the
work of arms.  Mr. Franklin Pierce was
President, but Mr. Banks had been elected Speaker
of the House of Representatives at the first
session of the Thirty-fourth Congress in
December, 1855.  Mr. Blaine said that marked
an epoch, and he described it in his brilliant
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
<i>Twenty Years of Congress</i> as "a distinctive victory
of the Free States over the consolidated power
of the Slave States."
</p>

<p>
But the Republicans were slow in coming to
power, and their nomination of General Frémont
in 1856 sowed distrust among the sounder men
of the party.  Mr. Buchanan's election seemed
to confirm the ascendency of the South, and the
mind of Boston, or at any rate of State Street,
reverted to commercial politics.  The Abolitionists
were as much under a cloud as ever.  From
1857 to 1860 things seemed to be going backward.
The Harper's Ferry business alarmed the
ingrained conservatism of Boston, and though the
hanging of John Brown shocked a good many
merchants and bankers, they could not understand,
and were far from approving, Brown's scheme
or Brown's methods.  The state of feeling in
Boston was, in short, confused, and the emotions
of 1854 had gone to sleep.
</p>

<p>
The crisis came in December, 1860.  The
Abolitionists tried to hold an Anti-Slavery
Convention in Tremont Temple, on the anniversary
of the hanging of John Brown or the day after.
They do not seem to have expected trouble;
at any rate, they took no sufficient precautions
to keep the peace and keep control of their own
meeting.  A "broadcloth mob"&mdash;the phrase long
since became classic in Boston&mdash;occupied the
hall in force, captured the platform peacefully,
elbowed the Abolitionists off it, appointed their
own chairman, Mr. Richard S. Fay, and passed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
their own resolutions.  "Broadcloth," said
Phillips, "does not make a gentleman."  The
Convention was summoned to consider "How shall
American slavery be abolished?"  The John
Brown anniversary was thought a suitable day
for the discussion of that question, but Brown's
death was referred to simply as "too glorious
to need defence or eulogy."  When Mr. Fay,
the ringleader of the mob, thinking his work
done, had departed, Mr. Frank Sanborn, the
lawful chairman, resumed his place, and would
have held the lawfully summoned meeting.  Then
the mob leaders, Mr. Murray Howe now at their
head, made a fresh attack.  The police sided
with them and the Mayor cleared the hall.
</p>

<p>
There is a little confusion of dates.  Brown
was, in fact, hanged December 2nd, the fateful
day of Austerlitz and of the Third Napoleon's
<i>coup d'état</i>.  But these events in Boston occurred,
I think, on the 3rd.  The men who had been
driven out of Tremont Temple by the mob, of
which the Mayor finally took command, reassembled
in the evening, very quietly, in a little hall
in Belknap Street, on what was impolitely known
as Nigger Hill, not far from the rather aristocratic
Mount Vernon Street.  Wendell Phillips, to an
audience of perhaps three or four hundred&mdash;all
the place would hold&mdash;made an unreported
speech, red-hot with wrath.  A little more than
a year before, November 1st, 1859, a fortnight
after Brown's attempt and while he lay in prison
waiting to be hanged, Phillips had spoken in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
Brooklyn, and announced that the lesson of the
hour was insurrection.  But he weakened the
force of that counsel by adding that the age of
bullets was over; it was an insurrection of thought;
like that of the last thirty years; he still had in
mind.  Now, here in Boston, and not for the first
time nor for the last, he was face to face with
forces which were not intellectual nor moral,
but forces of violence.  Phillips could not readily
shake off the influences of his whole public life.
He still believed in "moral suasion."  He was
presently to learn that moralities and the counsels
of peace were a poor defence against men prepared
to back their opinions with revolvers.  But even
after the hanging of Brown, at his grave in North
Elba, Phillips could say: "I do not believe slavery
will go down in blood.  Ours is the age of thought."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the meeting of December, 1860, marks
the beginning of his conversion, but by no means
its completion.  He had long been used to mobs
and mob law.  But now the lesson was being
pressed home.
</p>

<p>
A memorable evening to me, because from it
came my acquaintance with Phillips, whom I had
never met.  Under the spell, I suppose, of his
passionate eloquence, I went home and wrote
him a letter.  I explained that I was a Whig
that my family and friends were Whigs, that I
belonged in a hostile camp, but that I thought
there ought to be free speech in Boston, and I
would do what I could for that cause and for him
if he would say what.  I was, as most young,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
or old, men of Massachusetts then were, against
slavery, especially in Massachusetts, but not an
Abolitionist.
</p>

<p>
The next day, about noon, the door of my law
office in State Street opened, and Phillips walked
in.  Without a word of preface he said:
</p>

<p>
"You wrote me a letter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Will you come and see me at my house this
evening, and we will have a talk?  This morning
I have not a moment."
</p>

<p>
Again I said yes, and the door closed and he
was gone.  Often as I had seen Phillips on the
platform it seemed to me I had never seen him
till then.  A clear, strong, dry north light came
in at the windows and illuminated his face and
figure.  He had the bearing of a man to whom
authority and sweetness of nature belonged in
like degree.  He has been called a thousand times
the Apollo of the platform.  An Apollo he was
not except in graceful dignity and demeanour.
It his masculine beauty appeared to derive from
Greece, it had become Græco-Roman, and finally
borrowed its blonde colouring from some
Scandinavian Balder.
</p>

<p>
So careless was he of mere conventionality
that while he stood in the doorway, or just inside,
the soft light grey felt hat he wore, since known
as a Homburg hat, remained on his head.  When
I reminded him of it long after, he said with a
laugh:
</p>

<p>
"Well, you did not ask me to sit down."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
</p>

<p>
"No, you gave me no time."
</p>

<p>
I mention it because, with his hat on and his
hand on the door, his manner and bearing were
of a grave courtesy like none other.  And in
this transitory attitude, just on the wing, there
was a serene leisureliness as if to hurry were
unknown to him.  His eye took in everything
in these ten seconds.  There was not a word
beyond what I have repeated; a purely business
call to make an appointment.  But I knew when
he had gone that another influence had come into
my life, stronger for the time than all others.
</p>

<p>
I went in the evening, as I had been bidden, to
the little house in Essex Street where Phillips
chose to live, as if to measure the breadth of the
gulf that he had put between himself and the
world into which he had been born; a world of
easy circumstances if not wealth, and bound
together by a hundred social ties nearly all of which
he had broken.  Phillips had what at that time
would be called wealth, for which he had other
uses than mere expense on comfort.  A narrow
door opened into a narrow hall out of which
climbed narrow stairs, with a narrow landing
half-way up where the stairs turned, and at the
top a still narrower passage to the door of the
parlour.  Inside, the same impression of
restricted space; a room perhaps sixteen feet by
fourteen, and plainly furnished; a worn carpet
on the floor, a large shabby sofa at the end nearest
the door opposite the fire-place.  Phillips was
sitting on the sofa.  He rose and held out his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
hand: "It's very good of you to come.  I am
afraid I was abrupt this morning."  Then he
plunged almost at once into the situation, with
a forecast of what he thought likely to happen.
"Not much, if anything, till the meeting of the
Anti-Slavery Society in January.  That, I dare
say, they will try to break up.  Lincoln has been
elected President and Andrew Governor.  You
know what I think of Lincoln.  But Andrew I
know well, and I do not believe mob law will be
allowed to rule while Andrew is Governor."  He
had already described Andrew in Tremont Temple:
"For the first time within my memory we have
got a man for Governor of Massachusetts, a
frank, true, whole-souled, honest MAN."  Alas!
Andrew was to disappoint him bitterly in this
one matter of free speech, though in no other.
</p>

<p>
"But you are to speak in another fortnight
at the Music Hall," I said.  "Do you think
they will let you alone then?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Phillips, "that's on a Sunday";
as if that would matter to men whose passions,
interests, animosities, all led them to silence
the orator whom they thought, honestly enough
from their point of view, a public danger.  He
asked me if I had heard anything.  I had not,
but when Phillips told me he was going to speak
on "Mobs and Education" I answered, "But
that's a challenge."
</p>

<p>
"They can take it as they like," he replied,
quite softly and coolly, adding: "If you hear
anything perhaps you'll let me know."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
</p>

<p>
Our talk lasted late, turned on some personal
matters, then drifted far away to national issues,
and much else.  I thought Phillips, if anything,
more eloquent in talk than in oratory, yet with
never a sentence which had in it the ring of the
platform.  He was direct, simple, persuasive,
and luminous.  His frankness surprised me, but
he told me afterward he had made inquiries and
thought it safe to be frank.  No doubt he saw
that mine was a sincere devotion, and perhaps he
was aware of the enchantments he wove about
whom he would.  At any rate, he gave me his
confidence from the start.
</p>

<p>
During the next fortnight I saw many men
among my Whig acquaintances.  They made
no secret of their purpose to break up that Sunday
meeting at the Music Hall.  Soon these rumours
became public.  When the subject of Phillips's
discourse was announced, the rumours spread and
grew more menacing.  The police felt themselves
called on to take notice of what was likely to
happen.  Phillips, long used to dealing with
mobs, seemed to think the police superfluous.
Some of us who had looked into the matter well
knew they were not.  Seeing Phillips from day
to day, I asked him again and again to promise
his friends one thing, viz. that he would put
himself and leave himself in their hands.  He still
thought we were making too much of a slight
danger, but finally he promised.  There had been
mobs in Boston before this, where the police and
the mob had acted together.  They so acted
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
when Richard S. Fay and Amos Lawrence, and
Murray Howe and their friends broke up the
Anti-Slavery Convention in Tremont Temple on
the morning of December 3rd&mdash;this same month.
And it was that mob from which Phillips was
to take his text on this Sunday.  A piquant
situation, if it had not been something much
more serious, with all the materials of a great
tragedy.
</p>

<p>
This time the mob leaders, whoever they were,
had changed their tactics.  They did not propose
to capture the Music Hall or prevent Phillips
from speaking.  He was to be dealt with outside.
None the less did the police and Phillips's friends,
unaware of details, take measures to guard the
interior.  The police were in force in the lobbies
and passages and at the exterior approaches to
the platform; but out of sight.  Scores of them
were in the building, and a much larger force in
waiting hard by.  The platform, which ran from
one side of the hall to the other at the south end,
was garrisoned by Phillips's friends, armed.  The
enemy also were armed, and no man could say
what that Sabbath morning might bring forth.
Naturally, we did not know of the decision of
the mob leaders, all in broadcloth, to postpone
their assault till the meeting was over.  We
expected trouble inside, and were ready for it.
I said as little as possible to Phillips of what I
thought likely to happen.  I well knew that if he
were told there was any peril in freedom of
speech, his speech would be freer than ever.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
</p>

<p>
He always believed in personalities, saying:
</p>

<p>
"In such a cause as ours you must at all hazards
rouse attention.  Men whose minds are made up
against you will listen to a personal attack when
they will listen to nothing else.  If I denounce
the sin they go to sleep, but when I denounce the
sinner they wake up."
</p>

<p>
There was to be no going to sleep on this
eventful Sunday.  The speech on "Mobs and Education"
is perhaps the most personal, and the most
merciless, of all Phillips's speeches.  The
Tremont Temple rioters had delivered themselves into
his hands.  He knew every man among them
and the joint in every armour.  Many of them
were there on Sunday.  You saw the arrow
leave the platform and sink deep in the quivering
flesh.  The cheers were soon mingled with hisses.
The air grew hot.  But the majority were there
to hear and the hisses were silenced.  There
were passes of burning eloquence, of pathos, of
invective that tore its way through all defences.
</p>

<p>
"I have used strong words.  But I was born
in Boston, and the good name of the old town
is bound up with every fibre of my heart.  I
dare not trust myself to describe the insolence
of men who undertake to dictate to you and me
what we shall say in these grand old streets."
</p>

<p>
Thus spoke the aristocrat, the Bostonian proud
of Boston and of his own descent from six or
seven generations of the Boston Phillipses; an
aristocracy equal to the best.  His contempt for
the Fays and the rest of the "cotton clerks" was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
largely a contempt for the plebeian.  Plebeians,
to the Boston mind, most of them were.  Fay
is pilloried for ever in this speech; and others are
pilloried.
</p>

<p>
I will quote one passage, not from Phillips,
but a passage from Edward Everett on free speech
which Phillips himself quoted toward the end
of his discourse.  I quote it because Phillips
used often to say that American oratory had few
finer examples to show:
</p>

<p class="quote">
I seem to hear a voice from the tombs of departing ages,
from the sepulchres of nations that died before the sight.
They exhort us, they adjure us, to be faithful to our trust.
They implore us, by the long trials of struggling humanity,
by the awful secrets of the prison house where the
sons of Freedom have been immured, by the noble heads
which have been brought to the block, by the eloquent
ruins of nations, they conjure us not to quench the light
that is rising on the world.  Greece cries to us by the
convulsed lips of her poisoned, dying Demosthenes, and Rome
pleads with us in the mute persuasion of her mangled Tully.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is not often that a great orator opens his
heart to us about the merits of a rival, or whispers
to us any one of the secrets of his own or another's
eloquence.  I cannot remember whether Phillips
ever paid to Everett in public the tribute I have
often known him pay in private.  If he had lived
in an age when issues were less vital, or less deadly,
he might have found in Everett a model.  But
Everett has no passion, and passion is an element
in almost all Phillips's speeches.  And passion,
of quite another kind, fierce, vindictive,
murderous, he was to meet in another ten minutes.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
WENDELL PHILLIPS AND THE BOSTON MOBS
</h3>

<p>
Phillips's speech had been all through one
to stir deep resentment.  The atmosphere
of the Music Hall was seething with fierce passion,
and it seemed likely enough there would be a
rush for the platform when he had finished.  If
it had come it would have been met.  The little
band of armed men who concerned themselves
about his safety never left his side.  But there
was no rush.  The plans of the enemy were of a
different kind.  The audience passed quietly out
of the hall.  A police officer came to tell us
that there would be trouble outside.  A mob&mdash;of
course a broadcloth mob&mdash;had assembled.  What
the mob intended only the leaders of it knew,
but he assured us that the police were strong
enough to deal with it.  But he said Mr. Phillips's
friends should go with him when he left the hall,
and keep with him.
</p>

<p>
There were, I think, not more than half a dozen
of us who were armed&mdash;Le Barnes, Hinton, Redpath,
Charles Pollen, and one or two others.  We
told Phillips what he was likely to meet, and that
we should walk next to him.  When we got to
the outer door we found the police disputing with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
the mob the narrow passage, perhaps fifty yards
long, from the hall to Winter Street.  It was slow
work thrusting these disturbers out, because
Winter Street was crowded with the main body
of rioters, and there was no room for more.  But
the police knew their business, and meant to do
it, and did it.  Inside the passage there was not
space enough for an effective attack, even had
not the police been too strong.  But it took us,
I judge, some fifteen minutes to make our way
from the hall door to the street.
</p>

<p>
During this space of time the mob in Winter
Street roared at us.  They seemed to think we
were afraid to go on, and they flung at Phillips such
insults as hatred and anger supplied them with&mdash;coward,
traitor, and so on: with threats besides.
Phillips met it all with a smiling face.  His hand
was on my arm, so that if there had been any
nervousness I should have been aware of it.  But
the pressure of the hand was firm and steady.  He
was as cool&mdash;to use Mr. Rufus Choate's similitude&mdash;as
a couple of summer mornings.  The police
who had been a rear-guard, satisfied they were
not needed there, had gone to the front.
</p>

<p>
At first the mob gave little heed to the police.
They expected the police, as in Tremont Temple,
December 3rd, to be on their side.  But this time
an officer had command who knew only his duty
as policeman.  No politics but to keep the peace
and protect peaceful citizens.  The officer was
Deputy Chief Ham.  I have since seen a great
deal of police work in many parts of the world;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
in New York, London, Paris, Berlin, and elsewhere;
nowhere any better handling of a dangerous
mob than this by Deputy Chief Ham.  His force
was none too large, but his mastery over the
mob was never in doubt.  In their hand-to-hand
struggles in the little passageway the police
showed what they were made of.  Of Phillips's
friends the number had increased as we passed
from the platform, but if we had been alone we
should have been swallowed up, or we should have
been driven almost at once to use our revolvers.
But the police were an impregnable wall.
</p>

<p>
Once out in Winter Street, they formed in a
solid square, Phillips and his friends in the centre.
The square was never broken.  The mob were
many thousands strong.  There were wild rushes,
there was the tremendous pressure of great masses
of men, but against it all the police held good.
Down Winter Street to Washington Street, along
Washington Street to Essex Street, and in Essex
Street to the door of Phillips's house, the mob
kept us company, oozing and surging slowly on,
reviling and cursing all the way.  They thought
they would have a chance at the house, but the
Deputy Chief had taken possession there in
advance, and when the door opened we passed
comfortably in between the police lines.  It had taken
us an hour or more from the hall to the house.
The distance is a short half-mile.
</p>

<p>
It had been a murderous mob.  Phillips's life
was aimed at and had been in imminent danger
during that hour.  The spirit of murder was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
abroad.  The police warned us.  They thought
the peril over for the moment, but none the less
remained on duty near the house.  Men were
stopped and asked to state their business.  When
I returned in the afternoon an officer came up
to me but recognized me, nodded, and I went
in.  I found Phillips as cool as usual, the usual
sunshine in his blue eyes.  I told him what I had
heard from the police, and that I thought his
house ought to be garrisoned for the night.
</p>

<p>
"But who will undertake that?"
</p>

<p>
"Your friends know there is danger and will
gladly come."
</p>

<p>
He seemed a little sceptical and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Will you come?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."  I explained to him our plans.
He went into the back parlour and brought out an
ugly-looking pike.  "It was John Brown's," he
said.  No weapon could be more unfit for use
in a narrow hall or on winding stairs.  It might
have a moral effect.  It was agreed that three
of us whose names are above, should camp out
that night in the parlour.  When we arrived
about ten o'clock we found the table laid, with
food and drink for a much larger army.  The
night passed without alarm, as did following
nights, but neither our vigilance nor that of the
police relaxed.
</p>

<p>
During these days, and long after, Phillips
walked the streets of Boston with his hand on his
revolver.  I was sometimes with him.  I said one
day:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
</p>

<p>
"I am more afraid now they will try insult than
injury."
</p>

<p>
"Don't trouble about that.  I can see over my
shoulder, and before a man can touch me I shall
shoot."
</p>

<p>
He was a quick and good shot, as I found out
next summer, when I used to stay with him in
Milton, and we practised at a target.
</p>

<p>
But the memorable 21st of January drew on,
when the annual meeting of the Massachusetts
Anti-Slavery Society was to be held in Tremont
Temple.  Rumours again filled the air, and
something more than rumours.  I have already said I
had friends in the other camp.  One of them came
to me to beg me to let it alone.  "I care nothing
about Phillips," he said, "but you are my friend
and I must tell you what I know, though I am
betraying my own party."  "Then don't tell
it."  But he insisted.
</p>

<p>
His story came to this: That, knowing we had
organized in December for defence, they had
organized for attack.  A group of men outnumbering
ours would go to the Temple on the 21st, well
led and well armed.  Under the new Mayor,
Wightman, a more subservient tool of the mob
than his predecessor, Lincoln, the police would no
longer be allowed to protect the Abolitionists.  This
hostile band would wait on events a little, but if
Phillips and his friends were in the same mood as
at the Music Hall, they would be driven out of the
Temple.  "What do you mean by driven out?"  He
answered, gravely, "It would be truer to say
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
carried out.  We are determined to put down this
mad agitation.  They will not leave the Temple
alive."
</p>

<p>
My friend spoke in perfect good faith, but
it is needless to say I did not believe him.  I told
him so.
</p>

<p>
"Your friends talk, but they will not act.  They
well know that if they murder Phillips they will be
hanged for it."
</p>

<p>
"But will you not advise Phillips to stay away,
or at least to be moderate?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I will not.  If I did, it would be useless."
</p>

<p>
"But if you tell him what I say?"
</p>

<p>
"He would disbelieve it, as I do."
</p>

<p>
Our talk ended.  I thanked him, but said his
friends would find us ready; that I should, of course,
consider what he had said confidential, but it would
not alter our purpose.  He wished me to tell
Phillips, mentioning no names, and I might tell any of
our party who could be trusted.  Evidently he
hoped they would be more impressed than I was.
I did tell Phillips, who said, "You seem to have
queer friends."  I said something also to the two
men who were to be stationed at the ends of the
platform where the steps were, leading to the
platform from the body of the hall, the two most
dangerous points.  The only change they made
in their plans was to double the number of these
outposts.
</p>

<p>
From morning, when the Convention assembled
till the noon recess, and then all through the
afternoon the Temple was a scene of confusion, disorder,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
uproar; rioting even, but of no violence.  The
deep gallery opposite the platform was thronged
by the rioters.  The formal business of
organization once over, they broke in upon every
speech.  Nobody was heard.  Phillips, with all his
tact in dealing with such gangs, could do little.
Now and then a sentence rang clear.  A message
had gone from the Temple to the State House,
where Governor Andrew sat waiting, and watching
the course of events.  An answer had come back
by word of mouth, and had been misunderstood,
as oral messages commonly are.
</p>

<p>
In a lull, Phillips's voice was heard in a direct
appeal to the gallery mob: "We have a message
from the Governor.  The State Militia is on its way
to the Temple and will sweep that rabble where
it belongs&mdash;into the calaboose."  The rabble
thought it over for a while in silence, but began
again.  When the adjournment came Phillips
said to me: "I am going to Governor Andrew.
Come."
</p>

<p>
We found Governor Andrew in his room at the
golden-domed State House of Massachusetts.  He
greeted us cordially and listened while Phillips
stated his case.  Phillips urged that the
Anti-Slavery Society had a right to meet, a right to
transact business, a right to the free use of that
free speech which was a right attaching to citizenship
in Massachusetts; and a right to be protected
when that right was denied.  Primarily, he said,
it was the business of the police to keep order and
give protection, but the police, acting under the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
orders of Mayor Wightman, refused to do their
plain duty.
</p>

<p>
"Therefore," said Phillips, "I come to the
Governor of the State to safeguard citizens of the
State in the exercise of their rights."
</p>

<p>
Said Governor Andrew:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Phillips, what do you wish me to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Send a sufficient force of troops to Tremont
Temple to put down the rioters and protect law-abiding
citizens in the legal exercise of their legal
rights."
</p>

<p>
The Governor sat behind a table on which lay
a copy of the Revised Statutes of Massachusetts.
He opened it, handed it to us, and said:
</p>

<p>
"If you wish me, as Governor, to act, show me
the statute which gives me the power."
</p>

<p>
But Phillips was not to be turned aside.  He
answered, in tones slightly less cool than before:
</p>

<p>
"Free speech is a common law right.  The
power to which I appeal is a common law power,
inherent in the Governor as the Chief Magistrate
of the State."
</p>

<p>
But Andrew said again:
</p>

<p>
"Show me the statute."
</p>

<p>
And again:
</p>

<p>
"Show me the statute."
</p>

<p>
And from that he was not to be moved.  Seeing
that his mind was made up, Phillips turned away
abruptly, saying to me, "Come," and we departed.
As we went downstairs Phillips said:
</p>

<p>
"I will never again speak to Andrew as long as I
live."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
</p>

<p>
And we went back to the Temple, knowing at
last we had nothing to depend on but ourselves
and our revolvers.
</p>

<p>
Again during the interval my friend came to me.
He said: "You will be allowed to hold your meeting
this afternoon, though not without interruption.
But the attack I have warned you of will be made
this evening, and I once more beseech you to stay
away."  He knew, of course, it was impossible.
What took place after that in the councils of the
rioters I know not.  I have always supposed that
my friend, a man well known in Boston, went to
the Mayor and laid the case before him.  I do not
know.  What is known is that before the hour
when the Society was to assemble in the evening,
the Mayor closed the Temple.  His decision was
not imparted to us.  Phillips and I drove to the
Temple, and only on arriving heard what the
Mayor had done.  He was a weak Mayor, disloyal,
incompetent.  But he had perhaps prevented a
tragedy.  I think Governor Andrew, aware of the
probable course of events in the South and at
Washington, desired to avoid anything like a
conflict in Massachusetts.  He said as much to
me afterward.  That was his excuse.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
WENDELL PHILLIPS&mdash;GOVERNOR ANDREW&mdash;PHILLIPS'S CONVERSION
</h3>

<p>
There was one clear reason for the deadly
hatred of the pro-slavery faction in Boston
to Phillips.  He was the real leader of the
Anti-Slavery Party.  If he could be silenced, the voices
of the rest mattered little.  During twenty years
Garrison's influence had been declining, and
Phillips had come steadily to the front.  For the last
ten years he had stood alone.  It was his voice
which rang through the land.  His were the
counsels which governed the Abolitionist band.
His speeches were something more than eloquent;
they were full of knowledge, of hard thinking; and
the rhetorical splendour only lighted up a closely
reasoned argument.  What Emerson said of
speeches and writings in general was absolutely
true of Phillips's oratory; the effect of it was
mathematically measurable by the depth of
thought.  He spoke all over the North.  The
Conservatives had no match for him; therefore
he was to be put down by other means.
</p>

<p>
Passions ran, I think, higher in Boston during
those winter months of 1860-1, and the early
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
spring, than before or since.  Thanks to the
pro-slavery faction on one side and the Abolitionists
on the other, Massachusetts was within measurable
distance of civil war within her own borders.  After
Fort Sumter and Baltimore, these passions found
an outlet elsewhere.  For a time, the two Northern
factions merged into one people.  But during all
the years that have passed since I have known
nothing quite like the state of feeling which
prevailed that winter.  The solid men of Boston
thought they saw the fabric of society dissolving
and their business and wealth and authority
perishing with it.  The solid world was to exist no
more.  Naturally, they fought for their lives and
all the rest of it, and fought hard.  Their hatreds
were savage.  Their methods were savage.  We
seemed to be getting back to the primitive days
when men stood face to face, and the issue of battle
became a personal combat.  The Lawrences and
their friends were generally a little stout for the
business of battle, but the allies whom they brought
with them to Tremont Temple and the Music
Hall and the streets were good fighting material.
During all this time the Abolitionists were, as they
had been, a minority and on the defensive.
</p>

<p>
But this was the state of things which Governor
Andrew had in mind when he challenged Phillips
to show him the statute.  He did not want to
make the State of Massachusetts a party to this
conflict within itself.  If to keep order in the
streets or to keep a platform open to Phillips he
were obliged to move, he meant to have the law
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
with him.  No refinements, no Judge-made law, no
generalizations&mdash;for the common law after an
Atlantic voyage and a hundred years' sleep is
nothing&mdash;but a statute, printed, legible,
peremptory, binding alike upon Governor and citizens.
There was no such statute.  If anybody had
happened to think of it, no doubt there would have
been, but there was not.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the Governor sat still.  He was of
such a bulk that it seemed as if, while he sat still,
nothing could move.  He was, in size and build,
not wholly unlike Gambetta, though he had two
eyes, both blue, as against the one black, fiery orb
of the Genoese; and curling light brown hair instead
of the black lion's mane which floated to Gambetta's
shoulders; and a face in which sweetness
counted for as much as strength.  Like Gambetta,
he was well served by those about him.  He knew
accurately what was going on, and all that was
going on.  He told me afterward he did not know
on what information we acted, but he was
astonished we knew so much about what the enemy
intended.  When I reminded him that my
associations were mostly with the other side, he
reflected a moment and said: "Yes, that explains a
good deal."  I did not think it necessary to add
that, after Tremont Temple, we were on good
terms with the police also; since Phillips's appeal
to Andrew had been based on the alliance between
the police and the Lawrence mob; an alliance which
had in truth existed, at that time.
</p>

<p>
But the winter wore on.  Twice after the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
discourse on Mobs and Education, Phillips spoke in
the Music Hall&mdash;January 20th, 1861, on Disunion,
and February 17th, on Progress.  Both times the
mob supplied part of his audience inside and part
of his escort outside.  No violence was attempted.
The police were too strong, and the example of
Deputy Chief Ham had proved they were in
earnest.  If there was any violence, it was in
Phillips's speeches and language.  He was never
more provocative.  His forecast of the situation
was influenced by his wishes and theories.  All
his life he had been preaching disunion as the one
remedy for the slave.  Disunion seemed now at
last within reach, and at all costs he would do
what he could to promote it.  Indeed, he thought
it already accomplished.  Within six weeks after
Lincoln's election South Carolina had replied by
an ordinance of secession.  Mississippi, Alabama,
Georgia had followed, and all over the South
United States forts and arsenals had been seized
by State troops.  What was Phillips's comment?
</p>

<p>
"The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice.  The
covenant with death is annulled; the agreement
with hell is broken in pieces.  The chain which
has held the slave system since 1787 is parted."
</p>

<p>
He pronounced a eulogy on the Southern State
which had led the way:
</p>

<p>
"South Carolina, bankrupt, alone, with a hundred
thousand more slaves than whites, four blacks
to three whites within her borders, flings her
gauntlet at the feet of twenty-four millions of
people&mdash;in defence of an idea."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
</p>

<p>
A month later he was in the same mood.  It was
a trait of Phillips&mdash;not a good one&mdash;that he
attacked most mercilessly the men who hated slavery
as much as he did, but could not go as far as he
did.  In this February speech there is a long
lampoon on Dana; counsel for the slave in all the
fugitive slave cases, but never denying&mdash;what
lawyer ever did deny?&mdash;that there was a constitutional
obligation to return fugitives.  It is human
nature, but not the best side of it.
</p>

<p>
Such a reproach came ill from a man who denounced
the Constitution as a covenant with death
because of the compromises with slavery imbedded
in the great instrument of 1787.  Of these
compromises the rendition of fugitive slaves was one.
Phillips himself could not deny it.  The difference
between him and Dana was that Dana would bow
to the law and Phillips would not.  Dana would
do what he could by legal means to rescue the
fugitive.  He defended him in the courts.
Phillips would have defended him in the streets.  Both
men were needful to the time.  The Abolitionists
were very far from disdaining the use of legal
weapons.  When Theodore Parker had been
indicted and the Court, at the instance of his
counsel, quashed the indictment on purely technical
grounds, Parker exulted.  "It is a triumph for the
right.  We have broken their sword."
</p>

<p>
There came, however, the moment when Phillips
had to cast in his lot, for good or evil, with either
North or South.  He hesitated long.  He thought
and thought.  He talked with his friends, with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
man in the street, with the men who had lately
mobbed him.  One morning he came into my
office.  His sunny face was clouded.  He looked
anxious, almost ill.  He had to make the most
momentous decision of his life; and he could not
yet make up his mind.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"I came to talk to you because I know you are
against me.  What I have said to you before makes
no impression.  You still think I ought to renounce
my past, thirty years of it, belie my pledges,
disown every profession of faith, bless those whom I
have cursed, start afresh with a new set of political
principles, and admit my life has been a mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not the last," I said, "and as for
the others, are you not taking a rhetorical view,
a platform view?  But I will go further.  I don't
think it matters much what you sacrifice&mdash;consistency,
principles, or anything.  They belong to
the past.  They have nothing to do with to-day.
The war is upon us.  You must either support it or
oppose it.  If you oppose it, you fling away your
position and all your influence.  You will never
be listened to again."
</p>

<p>
And so on.  He sat silent, unmoved.  Nothing
I could say, nothing anybody could say, would
move him.  All his life long he had thought for
himself; in a minority of one.  It had to be so
now.  We talked on.  Finally, I said: "I will tell
you what I once heard a negro say: 'When my
massa and somebody else quarrel I'm on the
somebody else's side.'  Don't you think the negro
knows?  Do you really doubt that a war between
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
the Slave Power and the North, be the result what
it may, must end in Freedom?"  I am not sure
that I ever did hear a negro say that, but I hoped
that Phillips would open his mind to the negro if
not to me.  And I think he did.  I trust this little
artifice of debate was not very wrong.  I had to
urge what I could, but I knew Phillips would
decide for himself.  He left saying, "I will see you
again to-night."  I went to his house.  When I
opened the door of the parlour, there lay Phillips
on the sofa, asleep.  Ten minutes later he awoke;
lay silent for another minute, then said:
</p>

<p>
"We shall not have to discuss these things any
more.  I am going to speak next Sunday at the
Music Hall for the War and the Union."
</p>

<p>
And he began at once to consider how he should
announce his conversion.  Having gone over, he
took his whole heart with him.  No compromise,
no transition, not one word to retract, not a hint
of apology or explanation.  Yesterday an Abolitionist
to whom the Constitution was a covenant
with death and an agreement with hell.  To-day
a soldier for the Union.  Presently he said:
</p>

<p>
"It will be the most important speech of my life.
I don't often write, as you know, but I shall write
this and will read it to you when it is finished."
</p>

<p>
Two days later he sent for me again and these
were the first sentences I heard:
</p>

<p>
"Many times this winter, here and elsewhere,
I have counselled peace&mdash;urged as well as I knew
how the expediency of acknowledging a Southern
Confederacy and the peaceful separation of these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
thirty-four States.  One of the journals announces
to you that I come here this morning to retract
those opinions.  No not one of them."
</p>

<p>
I said: "Mr. Phillips, you will never get
beyond that.  They will not listen."
</p>

<p>
"Then they will be the last sentences I shall ever
utter in public.  But do you listen."
</p>

<p>
And he went on, in his finest platform manner
and voice:
</p>

<p>
"No, not one of them.  I need them all; every
word I have spoken this winter; every act of
twenty-five years of my life, to make the welcome
I give this War hearty and hot."
</p>

<p>
He knew what he was about.  When it became
known he was to speak for the Union, Charles
Pollen came to me and asked whether I thought
Phillips would like the Music Hall platform hung
with the American flag.  "Yes," said Phillips,
"deck the altar for the victim."  And decked it
was&mdash;a forest of flags; and the flags told the story,
long before Phillips opened his mouth.  There was
not a note of remonstrance as he announced his
refusal to retract.  And again he went on:
</p>

<p>
"Civil war is a momentous evil.  It needs the
soundest, most solemn justification.  I rejoice
before God to-day for every word I have spoken
counselling peace, but I rejoice also, and still more
deeply, that now, for the first time in my
Anti-Slavery life, I speak beneath the Stars and Stripes,
and welcome the tread of Massachusetts men
marshalled for war."
</p>

<p>
I never saw such a scene.  The audience sprang
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
up and cheered and cheered and cheered.  The
hall was a furnace seven times heated.  The only
unmoved man was Phillips.  He waited and once
more went on:
</p>

<p>
"No matter what the past has been or said,
to-day the slave asks God for a sight of this banner
and counts it the pledge of his redemption.
Hitherto it may have meant what you thought or what
I thought: to-day it represents sovereignty and
justice.  Massachusetts has been sleeping on her
arms since '83.  The first cannon shot brings her
to her feet with the war-cry of the Revolution on
her lips."
</p>

<p>
And so on to the end.  It was a nobler speech
even than in the printed report, for that came from
his manuscript and often he put his manuscript
aside and let himself go.  The inspiration of the
moment was more than any written words.  When
it was over there was again a mob outside; a mob
that would have carried the orator shoulder-high
to Essex Street.  The honest, strong face of the
Deputy Chief of Police wore a broad smile.  He
had done his duty.  His responsibilities were
ended.  He, too, had fought his fight.  Phillips
took it all coolly.  It was such a triumph as comes
to a man once in his career, and once only&mdash;the
finest hour in Phillips's life.  He never reached a
greater height of oratory, nor an equal height of
devotion.  For his triumph was over himself.

CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON&mdash;A CRITICAL VIEW
</h3>

<p>
In explaining why Wendell Phillips was the target
for every shot in the winter of 1860-1, I said it
was because he was the real leader of the anti-slavery
party during all the later and more critical
years of the long struggle for freedom.  No doubt,
Garrison at one time held the first place among the
Abolitionists.  He was the first of them in time,
or one of the first.  He had had the good fortune to
be mobbed and led through the streets of Boston
with a rope about his body.  He had founded a
weekly paper, <i>The Liberator</i>.  Georgia had offered
five thousand dollars reward for his arrest.  He
had unflinching courage and needed it all in the
'thirties and later.  But he had very moderate
abilities.  His force was a moral force.  He had
convictions and would go any length rather than
surrender any one of them.  But he had almost
no other of those gifts and capacities which make a
leader.  He had no organizing power.  He was
not a good writer.  He was not a good speaker.
He could not hold an audience.  He could not
keep the attention of the public which he had
won in the beginning.  He did not attract to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
Abolitionist ranks the ablest of the men who were
ready to make a fight against slavery.  They did
not care to serve under Garrison; under a leader
who could not lead.  They went into politics.
</p>

<p>
So it happened that the Abolitionists had become
a dwindling force.  If Phillips had not appeared on
the scene, with his wonderful oratory, his natural
authority on the platform and off, his brilliant
love of battle, his temperament, at once commanding
and sympathetic, his persuasive charm&mdash;the
Abolitionists would have been wellnigh forgotten.
He had all the moral force of Garrison, and the
intellectual force which Garrison had not.
</p>

<p>
Phillips himself would never allow this to be
said if he could help it.  He recognized Garrison
as leader, and was perfectly loyal to him.  So far
as he could, he imposed his own view on the public.
It was so abroad as well as at home.  When
Garrison came to London a meeting was held in
St. James's Hall in his honour.  Mr. Bright spoke
and others spoke, hailing the worn-out champion
as the herald of American Emancipation, which
perhaps he was.  Boston, which has periods of
generous penitence, gave him thirty thousand
dollars, others than Bostonians paying part of
the money, and accepted a bronze statue and put
it up&mdash;I forget where.  It has ever since been the
fashion to recognize Garrison as the moral
educator of the North on the slavery question; the
schoolmaster of his period.  Very possibly my
liking for Phillips warped my opinion at the time.
But now, after all these years, I think myself
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
impartial.  I had a knowledge of the situation.
If it is a wrong view, why was Phillips and not
Garrison the shining mark at which the pro-slavery
people aimed in those critical years from
1854 to 1861?  No other theory will explain that.
</p>

<p>
When I used to express an impatient opinion of
Garrison, and of Phillips's submission to him,
I was rebuked for it.  Said Phillips:
</p>

<p>
"You are unjust and you do not know the facts,
or you do not make allowance for them.  Like
other young men, you are of to-day.  Garrison's
work had been done before you were old enough
to know anything about it, and he is for all time.
I don't say there would have been no Abolitionist
movement but for Garrison, since Abolition was
in the air, and the anti-slavery fight had to be
fought.  It would have been fought in a different
way without him, and perhaps later.  You underrate
the moral forces and Garrison's capacity as a
leader.  He was a leader, and is.  Intellectual gifts
do not make a leader.  The soldier whom other
soldiers follow into the breach, and to death, need
not be a great captain, nor understand the art of
war.  What he understands is the art of getting
himself killed, and of inducing the men behind
him to do the same.  Garrison took his life in
his hand.  For many years he was leader of
a forlorn hope.  He held extreme views.  He
had to hold them.  He drove men away from
the Abolitionist camp.  They were better elsewhere.
He was not a politician, but politics were
not what we wanted, nor what the cause wanted.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
What it wanted was inspiration, and that is what
it got from Garrison."
</p>

<p>
I have put this in quotation marks, but I do
not mean that Phillips said it all at once, nor
perhaps in these words.  But the passage reproduces
as accurately as I can the substance of what
I have heard him say in many talks about Garrison.
I do not expect anybody to accept my view against
Phillips's.  But I must give my own, right or
wrong.  I saw something of Garrison, publicly and
privately.  I had no dislike for him, but neither
had I any enthusiasm.  As I recall the impressions
of those days, it seems to me that I have never
known a man of so much renown as Garrison
with so slight an equipment for the business of
leadership, or even of apostleship.  When I try
to sum him up, I am embarrassed by the want of
material.  After all, what did he say or do?
</p>

<p>
Borrowing from Isaiah a phrase of condensed
passion, Garrison had called the Constitution a
covenant with death and an agreement with hell.
Without Isaiah's help, he produced the only other
phrase which, out of all his writings and speakings
has kept a place in the general memory: "I will
not equivocate; I will not excuse; I will not retreat
a single inch, and I will be heard."  That was his
pledge in the first number of <i>The Liberator</i>.  It
was finely said, and well he kept it; so long as it
mattered what he kept.  I have often heard him
speak.  I cannot recall one single effort of
anything that could be thought oratory.  He was
a tiresome speaker.  Of rhetoric, or of that art
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
which goes to the making of good speeches, he
had no trace or tinge.  Between him and his
audiences there was no give and take.  He just
stood up on the platform and hammered away.
</p>

<p>
He was a fanatic, pure and simple.  He had a
message to deliver, and he delivered it as a
gramophone delivers its messages.  He was what they
call a record.  If he impressed his hearers, as he
sometimes did, it was by the passionate fervour
of his beliefs, and of his animosities.  He was at
white heat.  More often he wearied them.  They
got up and went away.  I suppose people read
<i>The Liberator</i>.  Dr. Johnson said you could write
anything if you set yourself to it doggedly, and
so it is of reading.  But the average reader feels
himself entitled to a little help from the writer,
and from Garrison he got none.
</p>

<p>
This, however, was in the early days of
journalism&mdash;it was ten years before Horace Greeley
founded <i>The New York Tribune</i> that <i>The Liberator</i>
was born.  A newspaper was then a newspaper,
whether it had any news or not; and even when its
editorials were written, as the elder Bennett said
<i>The New York Herald</i> editorials were written, for
men who could not read.  The printed page had
an authority because it was printed; an authority
which hardly survived Prince Bismarck's epigram
on the newspaper: "Just printer's ink on paper."  <i>The
Liberator</i> was violent, bitter, prolix, and dull.
But the Puritan preachers were all this, yet men
sat contentedly for hours beneath their intolerable
outpourings, as do the Scotch to this day.  Carlyle
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
had heard Irving preach for hours on end.  I
have sometimes had to sit under the Scottish
preachers, when staying at a highly ecclesiastical
house.  On these occasions I used to dream that
I was reading <i>The Liberator</i> or listening to
Garrison in the Boston Melodeon.  The a priori method
was common to both, and the absence of accurate
knowledge.  They did not master their subjects, nor
their trade.
</p>

<p>
As to what Garrison did, I am quite willing to
accept the history of his time as it is commonly
told.  I take all that for granted; all his services
to the anti-slavery cause; and, with all drawbacks,
they were great.  Still, I do not think they explain
his immense fame.  He was a Captain in the
army of the Lord, if you like, but a Captain who
won no battles.  There was one final victory,
based on a long series of defeats; a victory in which
he had a share, though not a great share.  Perhaps
a better Saint than Captain, but in Rome's long
catalogue of the canonized how many first-rate
names are there?  You can become a saint quite
cheaply if you know how.  There are fifty or
more huge volumes of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, mostly
lies, yet extremely interesting as examples of the
use to which the human imagination can be put
for ecclesiastical purposes.  A Benedictine labour,
ere yet science had shaken the foundations of
clerical fairy tales by its demand for evidence.
The acutest minds accepted them.  So late as the
nineteenth century they were still accepted.
After his "conversion," Newman, perhaps the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
finest mind of his time, swallowed whole all the
fictions to which the Church of Rome had given
the imprimatur of infallibility.  Garrison's exploits
are less legendary, but are they much more
substantial?  His fame rests on generalities.
</p>

<p>
To look at, he was neither soldier nor saint.  He
had not, on the one hand, the air of command,
nor, on the other, the sweetness or benignity we
expect from one of the heavenly host.  His face
was both angry and weak.  His attitude on the
platform was half apologetic and half passionate.
His speech at times was almost shrewish.  It was
never authoritative though always self-complacent.
So was the expression of his face, with its smile
which tried to be amiable and succeeded in being
self-conscious.  There was no fire in his pale
eyes; if there had been, his spectacles would have
dulled it.  He stooped, and his most vehement
appeals&mdash;they were often extremely vehement
came to you sideways.  It was an unlucky effect,
for there was nothing shifty or crooked in the
man's nature.  But he had a rôle to play&mdash;Isaiah,
if you like&mdash;and played it as well as his means
would allow.
</p>

<p>
It was the indomitable honesty of the man which
gave him such authority as he had.  That is not
a bad eulogy in itself.  Bad or good, nothing I can
say will diminish his reputation, nor do I wish it
should.  When a legend has once grown up about
a man it keeps on growing.  It has been decreed
that Dickens shall be a great novelist, and
Gladstone a great statesman, and Browning a great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
poet, and Herbert Spencer a great philosopher.
Each of these men was great in other ways, but
the legend is invincible.  So, no doubt, with
Garrison.  He will remain the Liberator of the Slave.
By the time the cold analysis of History reverses
that verdict, personal partialities will have ceased
to count.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
CHARLES SUMNER&mdash;A PRIVATE VIEW
</h3>

<p>
The anti-slavery leaders who emerged about
the same time from the groups of mediocrities
enveloping them were Wendell Phillips and
Charles Sumner.  So essentially was Sumner an
idealist that he might naturally have cast in his
lot with those who preferred ideals to party politics,
but other influences finally prevailed and he
embarked on that career which, in due time, made
him the leader of the anti-slavery forces to whom
freedom seemed possible by political methods.
On the whole, even among that group of men which
included Andrew, I think Sumner must be put
first.  His province was larger; the range of his
activities greater; and there were more moments
than one when he was the most conspicuous figure
in American public life.  Of his scholarship, his
legal attainments, his multifarious and accurate
knowledge, his immense powers of work, everybody
has heard.  I do not enter upon that.  The
Sumner I shall speak of is the Sumner I knew.
</p>

<p>
In the account, first published in <i>The New York
Tribune</i>, of my first meeting with Bismarck, in 1866,
I said that I had heard much from Bismarck which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
I could not repeat.  On my return, I saw Sumner.
Almost instantly he asked what it was Bismarck
had told me which I could not repeat in print.
The question was embarrassing enough, and I
answered rather slowly:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Sumner, much of what Count Bismarck
said that seemed to me confidential related to
diplomatic and international matters, and you
are Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations.  It would not have been said to you."
</p>

<p>
Sumner reflected a moment, then answered:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you are right.  I won't ask you about
anything which you think you ought not to repeat.
But you must consider that, notwithstanding all
that Bismarck has accomplished, he is still an
unknown force.  My own belief is that the future
of Germany lies in his hands.  The man who
could defy the public opinion of Europe in that
business with Denmark, who could defy the public
opinion and Parliament of Prussia, who could
govern four years without a Budget or a majority,
who could make war without supplies, and without
his country behind him, and his King only a
convert at the last moment to his policy&mdash;that man,
though he has put Austria under his feet and
Prussia in Austria's place at the head of Germany,
is, in my judgment, only at the beginning of his
career.  He is the one supremely interesting
figure in Europe at this moment.  I have never
met him; probably may never meet him.  But it
is important to me to know all I can about him.
Violate no confidence, but tell me what you can.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
I will make no use of it except to inform my own
mind.  When I have to deal with Count Bismarck,
I want to be able to picture to myself what
manner of man he is.  In diplomacy, a knowledge of
men is half the battle."
</p>

<p>
This long speech was characteristic of Sumner.
He was seldom brief or simple.  His mind overflowed.
In private, as in public, he was oratorical.
The sentences, as they came from his lips, seemed
to have passed through a mould.  He spoke with a
model before him.  The most sincere of men he
was never content to be himself and nobody else.
In the murmur of the flowing periods he often
uttered, you heard echoes of Cicero, of Bossuet,
of Burke.  Perhaps it was true of him&mdash;as Emerson
said, not of him&mdash;that his library overloaded
his wit.  He moved as if in armour; a mixed but
apt metaphor.  The chair in which he sat was a
platform, and his one listener was an audience.
He neglected, in his private talk, none of the arts
of the rhetorician.  Whoever has heard Sumner
in the Senate or in Faneuil Hall must remember
the imposing presence of the man; his stature: and
the leonine head with its waving black mane
which every moment he tossed from his forehead,
only to have it fall again half over his eyes.  The
strong features stood out sharply, the eyes were
alight, the lips moulded into plastic form the most
stubborn sentences, and the whole blended into
one expression after another at the will of the
speaker; each expression the visible image of his
thought.  He was so intent on bending his audience
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
to his will that he used without stint every weapon
at his command.
</p>

<p>
In private, all this was a little overwhelming.
As it comes back to me in memory, my view of it
is probably more critical than it was while I sat
and looked and listened.  But it still seems to me
extremely fine.  In England&mdash;the country of all
others where simplicity counts for most&mdash;Sumner
was thought emphatic; and the English do not
like emphasis, but they liked Sumner.  He was
first here as a young man, in 1838 and 1840, when
he was still in the late 'thirties; and these
mannerisms were presumably less mannered, or less
aggressive.  But the men and women whom
Sumner then came to know were men and women who
dwelt on the heights.  I suppose the average of
serious culture at that time in that class was at
least as high as it is now.  They liked a man with
a full mind.  Sumner had that; and he poured it
out in a flood.
</p>

<p>
Macaulay had taught his set, or the several sets
to which he more or less belonged, to endure
conversation which took the form of monologue and
rivalled the laborious accuracy of a cyclopædia.
People suffered under him.  Lady Holland and
Hayward and Lord Melbourne and others rebelled,
but there were not many who rebelled.  Sumner's
path had therefore been made plain, nor was he
dogmatic in Macaulay's way.  He was human
and his enthusiasms were human, and he was
sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
But when Sumner, in 1869, made his indirect
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
Claims speech in the Senate, seeking to induce the
Government to demand from England indirect
damages for the depredations of the Alabama, his
popularity in this country came to a sudden end.
His best friends were those who resented this
speech most hotly; and Mr. Bright most of all.
To Mr. Bright I once undertook to defend Sumner
or to explain him, for I thought he had been
misunderstood.  But Mr. Bright would not have it.
"The only defence is silence," he exclaimed, and
he was the more angry when I said: "That will do
for an epigram."  And we never referred to it
again.
</p>

<p>
So far as I could, I satisfied Sumner's interest
about Bismarck, whom I had seen at short range,
and with whom, on the evening in question, I had
spent some three hours alone.  Sumner asked
question after question, with one definite object;
he wanted to understand the man himself.  Once
or twice he put a searching interrogatory on
matters of diplomacy, or on the relations between the
King and his great Minister, which had to be
answered with reserve.  He showed an astonishing
knowledge of purely Prussian politics and even
of Prussian politicians.  He asked if it was true
that Loewe and the other Liberals had owned they
were wrong in opposing Bismarck, and when I
said yes, exclaimed: "Then they showed more
good sense than I expected."
</p>

<p>
I spent some days with Mr. Sumner in his house
in Lafayette Square, in Washington, now part of
a Washington hotel.  A plainly furnished house,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
hardly a home; chiefly remarkable for its books and
for Sumner.  He was a kindly host, anxious that
his guest should make the most of his visit, and
see the men he wanted to see.  I wanted to ask
him why he had, on a former visit, advised me not
to see Lincoln; but I did not.  But Lincoln was
now dead and among the giants who survived him
Sumner was the most attractive personality.
</p>

<p>
He became more attractive still some years later,
in 1872, when he came to Europe for the rest
which his long warfare, first with President
Johnson and then with President Grant, had made
imperative.  He came first to London, staying&mdash;or,
as the English perversely say, stopping&mdash;at
Penton's Hotel, St. James's Street; then a hostelry
of repute, now extinct.  He had a large suite of
rooms on the ground floor at the back; gloomy,
and intensely respectable.  I dined with him the
night of his arrival.  "I don't know what kind
of a dinner they will give us," said Sumner, "but
you shall have a bottle of Chateau Lafitte of 1847,
and the rest will matter less."  He loved good
Bordeaux, as all good men do; and his talk flowed
like old wine&mdash;a full, pure stream, with both
flavour and bouquet; and not much of the best
claret has both.
</p>

<p>
It is not possible to repeat much of Sumner's
talk, for it was mostly personal and intimate.  But
I asked him whether he still felt the effects of
those coward blows which Preston Brooks had
dealt him from behind as he sat imprisoned in
his chair in the Senate.  He was not sure.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
doubted whether he had ever completely recovered,
though it was now some sixteen years since that
particular piece of South Carolina chivalry had
been perpetrated.  He thought everything had
been done for him which could be done.  What
he told me may or may not have been printed.
I do not know.  When the moxa was to be applied
to his spine, Dr. Charcot proposed to give him
an anæsthetic.  "But," said Sumner, "does not
the effect you seek to produce&mdash;the
counter-irritation&mdash;depend more or less on the pain the
patient would endure without the anæsthetic?"  "Yes,"
Charcot admitted, reluctantly, "it
probably does."  "Then let us go ahead without
ether," said Sumner; and they did.  I understood
the treatment consisted in laying along the spine
cotton-wool soaked in oil and setting fire to it.
When, after two or three days, the burn is partly
healed, the operation is renewed, and the pain,
of course, more severe.  But no ether was
administered.  After his first attack of angina pectoris,
"the pain," said Sumner, "which I endured in a
single second from one of those spasms was more
than all I ever suffered from all the applications
of the moxa."
</p>

<p>
We went together from London by way of
Boulogne to Paris, staying two nights at Boulogne
at one of the beach hotels.  Sumner was like a
boy; his sixty-one years sat lightly on him and his
interests were as fresh as I had ever known them.
He loved the sea and the sea air; an air so much
more exhilarating on the southern coast of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
Channel than the northern.  He was amused to
hear that the customs authorities had passed all
our luggage&mdash;his and mine&mdash;because I had told
them he was a Senator; and still more amused
later when the Dover customs on our return had
shown him the same indulgence as "The Honourable
Charles Sumner"&mdash;honourable denoting in
England not political distinction, but membership
of a family the head of which is a peer.  In Paris,
as in London, we had rambled about the
book-shops.  "I dare say," remarked Sumner, "you
thought from my books at home that I cared
nothing for books as books; or for bindings.  But
you will see."  And he proceeded to buy a certain
number of so-called fine bindings: which, alas, were
not so fine as they ought to have been.
</p>

<p>
Less than two years after his last months in
Europe, he died.  I have still much to say about
him, and there are many letters of his to me which
I hope to print; but they are not here and I must
end.  When I remember what has been said so
often of Sumner by men who did not know him or
did not like him, I may be allowed to end with a
tribute of affection.  I thought him, and I shall
ever think him, one of the most lovable of men;
more than loyal to his friends, delighting in
kindnesses to them; of an implacable honesty,
sincerity, devotion to duty and to high ideals; an
American to whom America has paid high honour,
but never yet enough.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
EXPERIENCES AS JOURNALIST DURING THE CIVIL WAR
</h3>

<p>
My obligations to Wendell Phillips are mixed,
and one of them was an introduction to
<i>The Tribune</i>.  In the autumn of 1861 I wanted
two things: a holiday, and a chance to see
something of the war and the negro question at short
range.  At that time, Mr. Charles A. Dana was
managing editor of <i>The Tribune</i>, with Mr. Sydney
Howard Gay as his first lieutenant.  Phillips gave
me a letter to Mr. Gay, the result of which was
that Mr. Dana asked me to go to South Carolina
for <i>The Tribune</i>.
</p>

<p>
A word about Mr. Dana.  He had the reputation
at that time of being what the cabman called
that Mr. John Forster who was, among other things,
the friend and biographer of Dickens&mdash;"a
harbitrary gent."  I suppose Mr. Dana was arbitrary;
in the sense that every commanding officer must
be arbitrary.  But my relations with him, or my
service under him, lasted some months, during
the whole of which period I found him considerate
and kindly.  He liked, I think, to assign a man
to duty and judge him by the result; which meant
that the man was left free to work out his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
own salvation; or damnation, as the case might
be.
</p>

<p>
I was, of course, perfectly new to the business
of journalism and, equally of course, made many
mistakes.  But Mr. Dana was not the kind of
manager who fastened on this mistake or that as
an occasion for chastising the offender.  He judged
a man's work as a whole.  In the office, I am told,
he sometimes thought it needful to speak plainly
in order to enforce a steady discipline.  He had
been known to walk into the room of one of the
departmental editors, in full view and hearing of
the whole staff, and remark: "Mr. X, you were
disgracefully beaten this morning," in the tone
in which he might have said it was a fine day.
But the next morning Mr. X was not beaten;
nor the next.
</p>

<p>
Very possibly, between me and Mr. Dana's
wrath, if I roused it, stood Mr. Gay; a man of
soft manners and heart.  I cannot remember that,
directly or indirectly, any reprimand ever came
to me from Mr. Dana.  From Mr. Greeley there
came more than one; all well deserved.  With the
business of managing the paper Mr. Greeley did
not much concern himself.  With the results he
sometimes did, and when <i>The Tribune</i> did not
contain what he thought it ought to contain, he
was apt to make remarks on the omission.  While
I was at Port Royal in South Carolina there was
a skirmish at Williamston in North Carolina, a
hundred miles away.  Mr. Greeley thought I ought
to have been at Williamston.  Very likely I ought.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
But Lord Curzon had not at that time announced
his memorable definition of enterprising journalism;
"an intelligent anticipation of events that never
occur."  That epigram, delivered in the House of
Commons, may be supplemented by an axiom.
The business of a war correspondent is to be, not
where he is ordered, but where he is wanted.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of the Civil War&mdash;or, for that
matter, in the late days&mdash;the American Press
had little of the authority it has since acquired.
The heads of great departments of Government
still held themselves responsible primarily to the
President.  Berths on battleships were not then
at the disposal of the first journalists who wanted
one.  When I asked Commodore Steadman of the
<i>Bienville</i> to take me to Port Royal he politely told
me it was against the naval regulations to allow
a civilian on board a ship of war.  When I asked
him who had a dispensing power in such matters,
he said: "If the Secretary of the Navy should
order me to receive you as a guest, I should do so
with pleasure."  I thanked him and with the
courage of which ignorance is the mother,
telegraphed Mr. Welles.  No answer.  I telegraphed
again, saying it was the wish of Mr. Dana that I
should go to South Carolina on the <i>Bienville</i>.
The effect of Mr. Dana's name was magical, and
this time an answer came; that Commodore
Steadman had orders to give me a berth.  I
suppose the journalists of to-day will hardly
understand how there could have been a difficulty.  But
there were to be many difficulties.  Commodore
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
Steadman was as good as his word, and better;
and a kind host.
</p>

<p>
Admiral Dupont had captured the Port Royal
forts by the time I arrived.  A finer example of
the old type of naval officer than Admiral Dupont
our naval service never had.  Captain Raymond
Rodgers was his flag captain; another example
not less fine.  General W. T. Sherman was in
command of the land forces.  The winter passed
slowly away.  There was not much to do except
study the negro question; which was perhaps more
attractive when studied at a distance.  General
Butler, bringing the mind of a lawyer to bear on
the problems of war, and desiring a legal excuse
for annexing the personal property of the enemy
had announced that the negroes were "contraband
of war."  For him, the maxim that laws are
silent amid arms did not hold good.  He liked
to make laws the servant of arms.  The negroes
naturally came soon to be known as contrabands.
There were some months during which they were
called hardly anything else.  I called them so in
my letters.  It was characteristic of Phillips that,
after a time, he wrote to me to suggest that Butler's
phrase had done its work and that the negro was a
negro: a man entitled to freedom on other grounds.
</p>

<p>
But it was long before the word passed out of
use.  Butler had chosen the psychological moment.
The "contrabands"&mdash;with Mr. Phillips's
permission&mdash;who crowded the camps were mostly
from the cotton and rice plantations of South
Carolina and Georgia.  If you were not already
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
a convinced Abolitionist, they were not likely to
convert you.  But it was becoming daily clearer
that the negro had a military value; not at Port
Royal, however, where he was only a burden.
It was not an eventful winter at Port Royal.
There were expeditions by land and sea, and there
was the taking of Fort Pulaski, which I saw, but
I was glad to return to New York in the spring;
and then to join General Frémont in the
Shenandoah Valley.  The name of that commander was
still one of promise.  Except the name, there was
not much else for the purposes of war, but he had
a charm of manner and a touch of romance and a
staff on which one or two foreign adventurers had
places and did weird things.  "General" Cluseret
was one; an impostor who afterward found a
congenial home in the Paris Commune, with other
impostors.  That campaign came to nought, and
when General Pope, in July, 1862, was put in
command of the Army of Virginia, I found my
way to the headquarters of that redoubtable
warrior.
</p>

<p>
With him, in command of the Third Army
Corps, was General McDowell.  I don't know why
one's memory chooses trivialities as proper objects
of its activity, but it sometimes does.  One of the
most vivid among the impressions of those days
is the stout figure of General McDowell on his
horse, which he sat ill, his uniform awry, his sword
pushed behind him as far as it would go, his
strapless trousers ending abruptly halfway
between knee and ankle; then a space of bare flesh,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
and then some inches of white stocking, and then
a shoe.  But he had military gifts if not a military
air.  He was talking with General Pope, whose
unhappy proclamation about his headquarters
in the saddle had already been issued.  Unlike
McDowell, Pope looked a better soldier than he
was.  His six weeks' generalship on the
Rappahannock ended with the Second Bull Run, which
there was now no Billy Russell to describe in
words that blistered yet were honest words; and
with Chantilly.  The West suited Pope better
than the East, and to the West he returned.
In these six weeks he had made nothing but
mistakes and achieved only defeats.
</p>

<p>
Personally, General Pope was pleasant to deal
with.  It was while he commanded the Army of
Virginia that Mr. Stanton, then Secretary of War,
or perhaps General Halleck, issued orders for the
expulsion of all correspondents from the armies
in the field.  General Pope sent for me and told
me of the order.  Impressed at that time with the
sternness of War Office rule, I answered meekly
that I supposed I must go.  Said General Pope,
"This is not an official interview.  I imagine you
needn't go till you get the order."  A battle was
thought to be imminent; any respite was welcome.
I thanked him, went back to my tent, took what
I most needed, and rode off to an outpost where I
had a friend.  The official notification may have
been sent to my tent but never reached me.  And
so it happened that I saw such fighting as there
was on the Rappahannock, and at the Second
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
Bull Run, better called Manassas.  Interesting
to a student of war; not inspiriting to a patriot;
and not now to be described even in the briefest
way.  My only aim is to give the reader of to-day
some faint notion of what a war correspondent's
life in those days was like.
</p>

<p>
One incident I may note, as an example of
what may happen to a general who neglects the
most elementary rules and precautions of war.
At the end of a day's march, at sundown but the
heavens still light, General Pope bethought himself
that he should like to see what the country ahead
of him looked like.  With his staff and a
bodyguard of some sixty sabres he rode up a low hill
with a broad crest, open ground about it for a
hundred yards, and beyond that in front a thick,
far-spreading forest line.  General Pope and his
staff dismounted.  The cavalry were ordered to
dismount and loosen their saddle-girths.  Just as
this operation had been completed there came
from the wood beyond the open ground a rifle
volley.  As we stood between the sunset and the
enemy we were a pretty fair target.  There was
no time for orders.  Everybody scrambled into
his saddle as best he could and away we went.
</p>

<p>
But the firing woke up the advance guard of
our army, and they also began firing.  It soon
appeared that General Pope had unwittingly
passed outside his own lines, so that, as we rode
away from the fire of the Rebels we rode into the
fire of our own troops.  It was hot enough but
luckily did not last long.  The hill partly protected
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
us from the sharpshooters in grey, and our fire
was silenced after a moment.  But the horses
were well frightened.  It was impossible to pull
up.  We scattered and the horses went on for a
mile or so.  I never before so much respected the
intelligence of that animal.  There was nothing
to do but sit down in the saddle, but the horses
never made a mistake at full speed over an
unknown country, stiff with fences and brooks, and
nobody came to grief; nor, which seems more
wonderful, was anybody hit by the bullets.  A
good many remarks were made which hit General
Pope.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br /><br />
CIVIL WAR&mdash;GENERAL McCLELLAN&mdash;GENERAL HOOKER
</h3>

<p>
The failure of Pope's campaign and his retreat
upon the Capital demoralized his army and
demoralized Washington to an extent which few
remember.  The degree of the demoralization may,
however, be measured by the reappointment of
General McClellan to the command of the Army
of the Potomac and of Virginia.  In the absence
of any general whose name inspired confidence,
General McClellan was thought a synonym of
safety, or, at any rate, of caution, and he had not
wholly lost the confidence of his men.  He was not
expected to enter upon large operations.
</p>

<p>
An engagement near Washington was, however,
thought probable.  On a hint from a friendly
official I rode out one afternoon from Washington
to the army headquarters, expecting to be away
at most a day or two.  My luggage consisted of
a mackintosh and a tooth-brush.  I was absent
six weeks.  But this was not so tragic as it sounds,
for Maryland was a country in which, even with a
war afoot, it was possible to buy things.  In the
interval, I had seen two battles; South Mountain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
and Antietam, which came as near to being real
war as could be expected under General McClellan.
</p>

<p>
Correspondents were not now allowed with the
army in the field any more than in General Pope's
time.  We were contraband.  But so long as we
yielded nominally to the inhibition of the War
Office nobody seemed to care.  The War Office
was then named Edwin M. Stanton.  To this
day I have never been able to understand how
Mr. Stanton&mdash;a man all energy, directness of mind
and purpose, scorning compromise and half
measures and scorning those who practised them&mdash;came
to assent to the replacing of General McClellan
at the head of the Army of the Potomac.
But he did, and at first General McClellan seemed
to justify the new hopes newly placed in him.
He might have sat still, but after providing for
the defence of Washington he moved out upon an
aggressive-defensive campaign.  General Lee had
entered Maryland and McClellan went in search
of him.  He moved slowly, but he moved.  His
soldiers, so far as I could judge, believed in him
in spite of his disasters in the Peninsula.  His
generals, I think, did not.  I saw and talked with
some of them, for I found myself making this
campaign as a volunteer aide-de-camp to General
Sedgwick.  I had met General Sedgwick before,
and when I had to consider how I was to get
leave to go with the troops I went to General
Sedgwick and told him my difficulty.  "Come
along with me," he said.  That was all the
appointment I had.  It would not have been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
possible in a European army, but in the armies of
the Union many things were possible.  And it was
quite sufficient to take me outside of Mr. Stanton's
order about correspondents.  I was not a
correspondent; I was one of General Sedgwick's aids.
His kindness to me was a service for which I could
never be too grateful.
</p>

<p>
It was a still greater service because General
Sedgwick belonged in the category of fighting
generals, who were none too popular with the
general commanding, since he, mixing politics with
war, believed in half-beating the enemy.  Sedgwick,
so far as I know, had no politics.  Certainly
he had none in the field.  He was there to fight,
not to build bridges over which the Rebels might
come back into the Union.  It had become known
that General Lee had entered Maryland, to enable
her people "to throw off a foreign yoke."  He
was not, as it turned out, a welcome guest.
Maryland would have been much obliged to him if
he had stayed on the other side of the Potomac.
McClellan, taking time to think things over,
and perhaps not liking to be considered a foreign
yoke, advanced toward Frederick, Lee's headquarters
for the moment, at the breakneck pace
of six or seven miles a day.  I suppose McClellan
must have known that Lee wanted Harpers
Ferry.  But even after Lee's general order had
come into his possession, with specific directions
for the movement of each division, McClellan
hesitated and finally took the wrong road.
</p>

<p>
Hence the battle of South Mountain; a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
picturesque performance; part of which I watched by the
side of General McClellan himself.  At the moment
he was quite alone; his staff away carrying orders;
an officer now and then returning only to be sent
off again at once.  The general presently saw that
a stranger was standing near him and asked a
question or two.  I offered him my field glasses,
but he said he could see very well and declined
them.
</p>

<p>
There was in his appearance something prepossessing
if not commanding: something rather
scholarly than warlike; amiable, well-bred, cold,
and yet almost sympathetic.  His troops were
slowly forcing their way up the steep mountain
side upon which we looked.  It was, in fact, from
a military point of view, a very critical moment,
but this general commanding had a singular air
of detachment; almost that of a disinterested
spectator: or of a general watching manoeuvres.
The business of war seemed to be to him merely
what Iago calls "the bookish theoric"; and he
himself "a great arithmetician."  He had the
face of a man of thought.  Napoleonic, said his
idolaters, who called him the young Napoleon:
not considering dates, or not aware that when
Napoleon planned and won his great Italian
campaign, a masterpiece of war, he was
twenty-seven.  When McClellan planned and lost his
Peninsula campaign, he was thirty-seven.  But
there he stood; an interesting figure; as if
stargazing.  Compact, square-chested, his face well
moulded.  That he was directing the assault of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
the forces struggling up yonder hill no human
being could have guessed.  Whether his tailor
had been too stingy in the material of his uniform,
or Nature too lavish in the contents of it, he was
uncomfortable; he and his clothes did not seem
made for each other.  There were wrinkles.
There was a missing button; nor was he a well
set-up figure.  It may well enough have been
because of his military career, but I thought an
air of indecision hung about him.  Men had died
by hundreds and were yet to die because he could
not make up his mind, nor push an attack home.
They were dying now, as he looked on; they lay
dying and dead on the opposite slope; for when he
had at last made up his mind he had made it up
wrong.  The battle of South Mountain was a
victory in a sense, but it need never have been
fought.  A position which might have been turned
had been forced, and the road to Antietam lay
open.
</p>

<p>
Again it was like McClellan, on approaching
Sharpsburg and the battleground of Antietam, to
halt and think it over.  If he had struck at once,
he would have found Lee's army divided and the
path weakly held.  But McClellan had it not in
him to do anything at once, or to do it once for all.
The armies faced each other idly all that day.
In the afternoon I heard that a flank movement
on the enemy's left was to be tried under General
Hooker.  So I rode over and joined that general's
command.  It was well known that Hooker would
fight if he was allowed.  He was already called
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
"Fighting Joe"; a well-earned sobriquet.  He put
his troops in motion about four o'clock that
afternoon, himself at the head as usual, doing his own
reconnoitring.  I rode with the staff, not one of
whom I knew.  Nobody took the trouble to ask
who I was or why I was there.  For aught they
knew I might have been a Rebel spy.
</p>

<p>
General Hooker had his own way of doing things.
This was what might be called a reconnaissance
in force; two brigades in line pushing steadily
forward; a force of cavalry in advance, two
divisions following.  By the time we came in touch
with Lee's left, it was dusk.  We could see the
flashes of the Rebel rifles which drove Hooker's
cavalry back upon the infantry division.  Hooker
played the game of war as the youngest member
of a football team plays football.  He had to the
full that joy of battle which McClellan never had
at all; and showed it.
</p>

<p>
Between the man by whose side I had stood two
days before at South Mountain, and the man near
whom I now rode, the contrast was complete.
McClellan was not a general; he was a Council of
War, and it is a military axiom that councils of
war never fight.  He surveyed the field of battle
beneath him at Turner's Gap as a chess-player
surveys the board.  At the naval battle of
Santiago, as the Spanish ships were sinking, our
bluejackets began to cheer.  Said Admiral Philip:
"Don't cheer, boys.  They are dying over there."  If
everything else about Philip should be forgotten,
that will be remembered; and he will be loved
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
for it; for this one touch of human feeling for a
human enemy amid the hell of war.  But for the
pawns and pieces the chess-player sends to slaughter
he has no regrets.  I don't say McClellan had
none for the men whom his mistaken strategy
drove to death.  All I say is that as I looked at him
I saw no sign of it.  A general, we are told, can
no more afford to have feelings amid a battle than
a surgeon with the knife in his hand can feel for
his patient.  It may be.  But Napoleon, who is
always cited as the highest example of indifference
to the lives of men, is perhaps the best example
to the contrary.  He would sacrifice a brigade
without scruple for a purpose; never one single
armed man without a purpose.  He had men
enough to consume for victory; never one to
squander.  He was an economist of human life,
though for purely military reasons.  It is awful
to reflect how many thousands of Americans in
these early Civil War days were sent to death
uselessly by the ignorance of their commanders;
or as in McClellan's case by his irresolution, and
his incapacity for the handling of troops in the
field.
</p>

<p>
General Hooker's was a face which lighted up
when the battle began.  The man seemed transformed.
He rode carelessly on the march, but sat
straight up in his saddle as the martial music of
the bullets whistled past him.  He was a leader
of men, and his men would have followed him and
did follow him wherever he led.  Hesitation, delay,
he hated them.  "If they had let us start earlier
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
we might have finished to-night," he muttered.
But night was upon us, and even Hooker could
not fight an unknown force on unknown ground
in the dark.  It was nine o'clock when we went
into camp; Union and Rebel lines so close that the
pickets got mixed and captured each other.
"Camp" is a figure of speech.  We lay down on
the ground as we were.  I slept with my horse's
bridle round my arm.  At four o'clock next morning,
with the earliest light of a coming dawn and
as soon as a man could see the sights on his rifle,
the battle began.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br /><br />
CIVIL WAR&mdash;PERSONAL INCIDENTS AT ANTIETAM
</h3>

<p>
General Hooker was about the first man
in the saddle.  The pickets had begun
sniping long before dawn.  My bivouac was within
sight of his tent.  "The old man," said one of
his staff, "would have liked to be with the
pickets."  No doubt.  He would have liked to be
anywhere in the field where the chance of a bullet
coming his way was greatest.  Kinglake has a
passage which might have been written for Hooker.
That accomplished historian of war remarks that
the reasons against fighting a battle are always
stronger than the reasons for fighting.  If it were
to be decided on the balance of arguments, no battle
would ever be begun.  But there are Generals who
have in them an overmastering impulse of battle;
it is in the blood; temperament prevails over
argument, and they are the men who carry on
war.  Hooker was one of them.  He loved fighting
for fighting's sake, and with the apostles of
peace at any price he had not an atom of
sympathy.  He would have thought Herbert Spencer
something less than a man, as he was; and
Mr. Carnegie, if he had been anything then but the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
boy he has never outgrown, a worthy disciple of
an unworthy master.
</p>

<p>
No, I am not keeping you waiting for the story
of Antietam, for I am not going to re-tell it.  But
General Hooker, on that day a hero, has had hard
measure since, and I like to do him what justice
I can.  I liked the man.  My acquaintance with
him began that morning.  To hear him issue an
order was like the sound of the first cannon shot.
He gathered up brigades and divisions in his hand,
and sent them straight against the enemy.  That
is not at all a piece of rhetoric.  It is a literal
statement of the literal fact.  His men loved him and
dreaded him.  Early in the morning he had scattered
his staff to the winds, and was riding alone,
on the firing line.  Looking about him for an
officer, he saw me and said, "Who are you?"  I
told him.  "Will you take an order for
me?"  "Certainly."  There was a regiment which seemed
wavering, and had fallen a little back.  "Tell the
colonel of that regiment to take his men to the
front and keep them there."  I gave the order.
Again the question:
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"The order is General Hooker's."
</p>

<p>
"It must come to me from a staff officer or from
my brigade commander."
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  I will report to General Hooker
that you decline to obey."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for God's sake don't do that!  The Rebels
are too many for us but I had rather face them
than Hooker."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
</p>

<p>
And on went his regiment.  I returned to
Hooker and reported.  "Yes," said he, "I see,
but don't let the next man talk so much"; and I
was sent off again.
</p>

<p>
I was with Hooker when he was wounded, about
nine o'clock.  He was, as he always was, the
finest target in the field and a natural mark for
the Rebel sharpshooters.  It was easy to see that
they followed him, and their bullets followed him,
wherever he rode.  I pointed that out to him.
He replied with an explosion of curses and
contempt.  He did not believe he could be hit.  No
Rebel bullet was to find its billet in him.  He was
tall and sat high in his saddle.  He was of course
in uniform&mdash;no khaki in those days, but bright
blue, and gilt buttons and all the rest of it; his
high-coloured face itself a mark, and he rode a
white horse.  Not long after I had spoken, a
bullet struck him in the foot.  It was the best
bullet those troublesome gentlemen in grey fired
that morning.  He swayed in the saddle and fell,
or would have fallen if he had not been caught.
Then they carried to the rear the hope of the
Union arms for that day; and for other days to
follow.
</p>

<p>
I saw him again about four in the afternoon.
I had been asked to see him by one or two of
General McClellan's staff who knew I had been
with General Hooker in the morning.  I have
said long since what the errand was they wished to
lay upon me, or what I supposed it to be.  General
Wilson explained to me, on the publication of that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
article, that I had mistaken the meaning of the
men I talked with; that the officers who asked me
to go never designed that I should suggest to
Hooker to take command of the army, but only
to find out whether he could resume the command
of his own corps; and perhaps of another; not
waiting for orders, apparently.  It does not much
matter, for I, of course, declined to carry any such
message as I thought was proposed to me.  It was
for the officers themselves, if for anybody, to carry
it.  If they had any such purpose in mind, it was
mutiny; patriotic but unmilitary.  Well might
they lose patience when they saw the promise of
a shattered rebellion fade before their eyes.  But
that day was not yet, happily, since a premature
victory over the South would have left great
questions unsettled.  This scheme, or dream, was
none the less interesting because it showed, as I
thought, what McClellan's own officers thought
of his generalship on that fateful day; and possibly
of something besides his generalship.
</p>

<p>
But I went to the little square red-brick house
where Hooker had been taken, and was allowed to
see him.  It needed no questions.  He was too
evidently done for; till that day and many days to
come had passed.  He was suffering great pain.
I told him I had come by request of some of General
McClellan's staff to ask how he was.
</p>

<p>
"You can see for yourself," he answered faintly.
"The pain is bad enough, but what I hate to think
is that it was a Rebel bullet which did it."
</p>

<p>
His courage was indomitable; his contempt for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
the Rebels not one whit abated.  He asked for
the latest news from the field of battle.  I told
him it was no longer a field of battle; that
McClellan was resting on his arms; that he would not
use his reserves; and that there was every prospect
that Lee would escape with his beaten army across
the Potomac.  He raged at the thought.
</p>

<p>
"Unless,"&mdash;I added.
</p>

<p>
"You need not go on," retorted Hooker.  "You
must see I cannot move."
</p>

<p>
It tortured him to think that his morning's
work was half thrown away; and that McClellan,
with some fourteen thousand fresh troops, was
content to see the sun go down on an indecisive
day.  Into his face, white with the pain which
tore at him, came heat and colour and the anger
of an indignant soul.  The surgeon shook his head,
and I said good-bye.
</p>

<p>
I rode back to headquarters; only to find that
the decision had been taken or perhaps that
McClellan was incapable of any decision; his mind
halting, as usual, between two opinions; and the
negative in the end prevailing over the positive.
He had an irresistible impulse to do nothing he
could leave undone.  I asked for General
Sedgwick.  He had been badly wounded&mdash;I think
thrice wounded, but had fought on till the third&mdash;and
been carried off the field.  Nobody could tell
me where he was.  I saw him once again.  A
Rebel bullet laid him low at Spottsylvania.  One
of the best generals we had: a man of utterly
transparent honesty, simplicity, and truth of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
character; trusted, beloved, ardently followed by
his men; a commander who had done great things
and was capable of greater.
</p>

<p>
Since it was too late to get anything through
to New York that night, I wasted some hours in
one camp and another.  Perhaps they were not
wasted.  I heard everywhere a chorus of
execration.  McClellan's name was hardly mentioned
without a curse.  Not a soldier in the ranks who
did not believe it had been possible to drive Lee
into and over the Potomac.
</p>

<p>
At nine o'clock in the evening I started for
Frederick, thirty miles away.  My horse had two
bullets in him, and I had to commandeer another
from a colleague, who objected but yielded.  I
reached Frederick at three in the morning, sleeping
in the saddle a good part of the way, as I had been
up since four o'clock of the morning before.  The
telegraph office was closed, and nobody knew
where the telegraph clerk lived.  I thought it odd
that in time of war, and after an important battle,
the Government at Washington should have kept
open no means of communication with the general
commanding; but so it was.  Frederick was the
nearest and, so far as I knew, the only available
telegraph office.  There was no field telegraph.
The wires were not down, but the operator was
sleeping peacefully elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
He reappeared about seven.  I asked him if he
would take a message.  After some demur he
promised to try to get a short one through.  I sat
down on a log by the door and began to write,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
giving him sheet after sheet till a column or more
had gone, as I supposed, to New York.  <i>The
Tribune</i> had been notified that a message was
coming.  But neither my private notice to <i>The
Tribune</i> nor my story of the battle was sent to
New York.  It was sent to the War Office at
Washington, and such was the disorder then
prevailing that it was the first news, or perhaps
only the first coherent account, of the battle which
reached the War Office and the President.
They kept it to themselves during all that day.
At night, in time for next morning's paper, it
was released, wired on, and duly appeared in
Saturday's <i>Tribune</i>.
</p>

<p>
I never doubted that when my telegram had
once been sent I should find a train to Baltimore.
There was none.  I saw one official after another.
Nobody knew, or nobody would say, when a train
would leave.  It might go at any moment, or not
at all.  I tried in vain for a special.  There could
be no special without military warrant.  I wired
the War Office and got no answer.  It was trying
work, for what I had hoped was to reach New
York in time for Saturday morning's paper.
Finally, I was allowed to travel by a mixed train
which arrived in Baltimore some ten minutes before
the Washington express for New York came in.
</p>

<p>
That is all the margin there was.  The cars
were lighted by oil lamps, dimly burning, one at
each end of the car, hung near the ceiling.  I had
to choose between the chance of wiring a long
and as yet unwritten dispatch from Baltimore,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
and going myself by train.  The first word at
the telegraph office settled it.  They would
promise nothing.
</p>

<p>
So by the light of the one dim oil lamp, above
my head, standing, I began a narrative of the
battle of Antietam.  I wrote with a pencil.  It
must have been about nine o'clock when I began.
I ended as the train rolled into Jersey City by
daylight.  The office knew that a dispatch was
coming, the compositors were waiting, and at six
o'clock the worst piece of manuscript the oldest
of them had ever seen was put into their hands.
But they were good men, and there were proof-readers
of genius, and somewhere near the uptown
breakfast hour, <i>The Tribune</i> issued an extra with
six columns about Antietam.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br /><br />
A FRAGMENT OF UNWRITTEN MILITARY HISTORY
</h3>

<p>
By this time&mdash;September, 1862&mdash;Mr. Dana had
retired from <i>The Tribune</i> and Mr. Sydney
Howard Gay had become managing editor in
Mr. Dana's place.  The natural gift of command
which belonged to Mr. Dana had not descended
upon Mr. Gay; it never does descend; but he was
capable of a quick decision, and when, having
returned that morning from Antietam, I saw him
in the afternoon, he was in a managing-editor
state of mind.  With much firm kindness of
manner he suggested that I should start that evening
to rejoin the army.  I said yes, because, in my
inexperience and in my artless awe of my superior
officer, I did not know what else to say.  And I
took the night train to Washington.
</p>

<p>
With the discomforts of the night railway
service between New York and Washington I had
already made acquaintance.  They were considerable,
but less than they are now.  There was
then no overheated Pullman car; there was no
overbearing coloured porter to patronize you, and
to brush the dust from other people's clothes into
your face, and to heat the furnace&mdash;by which I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
mean the steam-heated car&mdash;seven times hotter;
there was no promiscuous dormitory.  When Lord
Charles Beresford was last in Washington, four or
five years ago, he told me one afternoon he was
going to New York by the midnight train.  When
I suggested that the day service was less
unpleasant than the night, he answered: "Oh, it doesn't
matter to me.  I can sleep on a clothes-line."  There
spoke the sailor lad of whom there are still
traces in the great admiral of to-day.  I have
never tried the clothes-line, but I had lately been
sleeping for many nights together on the sacred
soil of Virginia, or the perhaps less sacred soil of
Maryland, thinking myself lucky if I could borrow
two rails from a Virginia fence to sleep between.
I am not sure whether I liked the stiff seats of the
old-fashioned coach much better, but I am quite
sure I should prefer the open air and the sacred
soil and the Virginia rails to the "luxurious"
stuffiness of the modern sleeping car.  The only
real luxury I know of in American railway travel
is the private car.
</p>

<p>
However, I might as well have stayed in New
York, for I was soon invalided back again with
a camp fever, and then remained in the office to
write war "editorials," and others.
</p>

<p>
But I was to make one more journey to the
field, and once more to see General Hooker.
General McClellan, thinking it over for a month and
more after Antietam, had finally crossed the
Potomac, dawdled about a little, and been ordered
to Trenton, New Jersey, well out of the way of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
further mischief.  General Burnside had
succeeded McClellan; had fought and lost the battle
of Fredericksburg, with the maximum of
incompetency, in December, 1862; had McClellanized
till January 25th, and had then yielded up the
command of the unhappy Army of the Potomac
to General Hooker.  Fighting Joe spent some
three months in getting his army into good fighting
order; then tried his luck against Lee and
Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville.  Luck in the
shape of a bullet, whether Union or Rebel took
Jackson out of his way; but Lee, perhaps for the
first time, showed the greater qualities of
generalship, and Hooker, at the end of a three days
battle, was defeated; the Union forces recrossing
the Rappahannock on the night of May 4th, 1863.
</p>

<p>
I must apologize for restating, even in the
briefest form, facts which everybody knows.  I
do it because, soon after Chancellorsville, I was
sent again to the Army of the Potomac on a
mission of inquiry.  It was almost the blackest period
of the war; the darkness before dawn; a dawn
which was to come from the West as well as from
the East.  The army was demoralized; so was
public opinion; so, I think, were the military
authorities in Washington; and nobody knew
where to look for a commanding officer.  There
remained not one in whom the President or
the Army of the Potomac had faith.  They were
groping for a General, and groping so far as the
East was concerned, in the dark.  My business
was to throw such as light as I could on the causes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
of Hooker's defeat, and to find out, if I could, whom
the Army of the Potomac wanted as leader.  And
I was given to understand that the results of my
inquiry would be published in <i>The Tribune</i>.
</p>

<p>
They never were.  I spent rather more than a
week with the army, at one headquarters or
another.  General Hooker, to whom I of course
presented myself in the first instance, very kindly
asked me to be his guest, but that was impossible.
I could not be the guest of the man whom I was to
investigate.  I told Hooker my errand.  As
General commanding, he had the right to order me out
of the lines, which would have brought my mission
to an end.  Instead, he offered me all facilities
consistent with his duty.  "If I am to be
investigated," he said, rather grimly, "it might as well
be by you as anybody."  Indeed; he had a kindness
for me and had offered me, or tried to offer,
after Antietam, a place on his staff; which military
regulations did not permit.  It was not necessary
to tell him I had every wish he might come well out
of the examination.  But I had.
</p>

<p>
So I went about to one general and another and
from one corps to another, and talked with men of
all ranks and of no rank.  I knew General
Sedgwick best and went to him first.  He was a man
of action rather than words, and was reluctant to
talk.  Besides, his share in the battle had been
greater than anybody's but Hooker himself.  He
told me what his orders had been, and how he had
tried to carry them out.  Up to a certain point, he
had been successful.  He had crossed the Rappahannock
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
in the early morning of May 3rd,
carried the heights near Fredericksburg by noon,
advanced toward Chancellor's with intent to turn
Lee's rear, till he brought up against an immovable
Rebel force late in the afternoon.  He held his
position all night and during most of the next day,
the 4th.  Then Lee, who was at his best, brought
up more troops, and forced Sedgwick back across
the river at night.  He had lost five thousand
men.
</p>

<p>
From what Sedgwick told me and from what
others told me, I gathered that this was the critical
point of the battle.  If Hooker could either have
kept these Rebel reinforcements busy elsewhere,
or have strengthened Sedgwick earlier in the day,
the Rebel lines would have been broken or turned,
and the battle won.  But he was outmanoeuvred
by Lee, here and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
That is Chancellorsville in a nutshell.  Hooker
was, I suppose, overweighted with the command of
an army of a hundred and twenty thousand men.
As a corps commander and for fighting purposes,
he had no equal.  But he was pitted against a
General whom European critics have praised till
they seem inclined to put him on a level with
Hannibal or Moltke, where he certainly does not
belong.  But he was good enough in these May
days of 1863 to defeat General Hooker.
</p>

<p>
There have been stories in print to which I
refer because they have been in print.  It was said
of General Hooker, as it was said of a greater
General in this Civil War, that he drank.  Lincoln's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
wish to send a barrel of Grant's whisky to
every other General in the Union armies had not
then been expressed.  But, in the first place,
having heard this rumour before I left New York,
I asked everybody likely to know, and not one
witness could testify to having seen General
Hooker the worse for whisky.  There is, in the
second place, a statement that while Hooker was
standing, on the morning of the 3rd, near
Chancellor's Inn, the porch was struck by a cannon
shot, and a beam fell on Hooker's head.  He was
not disabled, but the working power of his brain,
at high pressure night and day for some sixty
hours, may well have been impaired.  One story
may be set off against the other.
</p>

<p>
Rightly or wrongly, the Army of the Potomac
had lost confidence in General Hooker.  It had
also lost confidence in itself.  It was a beaten army
and the soul had gone out of it.  On both points,
the evidence was overwhelming.  There could be
no doubt that I must report to Mr. Gay that
the demoralization was complete.  When I set
myself to discover a remedy&mdash;in other words a
possible successor to General Hooker&mdash;I was at a
loss.  General Sedgwick's officers and men
believed in him, but the army as a whole thought
he was in his right place as a corps commander.
Other names were mentioned and put aside.
There was no reason why officers high in rank
should talk freely to me.  There was every reason
they should not talk freely to the representative
of <i>The Tribune</i>, if <i>The Tribune</i> was to publish an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
account of the state of public opinion in the army
with reference to a new commander.  I endeavoured
to make it clear that all statements on
this matter would be treated as confidential.
Still, as you may imagine, there were difficulties.
</p>

<p>
If one man was named more often than another,
it was General Meade.  I was urged by a number
of officers&mdash;mostly staff officers&mdash;as I had been at
Antietam in connection with General Hooker, to see
General Meade and lay before him what my friends
declared to be the wish of the army, or of a great
part of the army.  They wanted him to succeed
General Hooker.  It did not seem desirable to
pledge myself to anything, but I did see General
Meade.  I had met him but once before.  He
was just mounting his horse, and proposed that
we should ride together.  Explaining that, though
I came on no mission and with no authority, I had
been asked to lay certain matters before him, I
gave him such an account as I could of what my
friends thought the army wanted.  When he saw
what was coming, he turned as if to interrupt.
"I don't know that I ought to listen to you," he
said.  But I asked him to consider that I was a
civilian, that I was in no sense an ambassador,
that I brought no proposals, that he was asked to
take no step whatever not even to say anything,
but only to hear what others thought.  Upon
that, I was allowed to go on.  I said my say.
From beginning to end, General Meade listened
with an impassive face.  He did not interrupt.
He never asked a question.  He never made a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
comment.  When I had finished I had not the
least notion what impression my narrative had
made on him; nor whether it had made any
impression.  He was a model of military discretion.
Then we talked a little about other things.  I
said good-bye, rode away, and never again saw
General Meade.  But Gettysburg was the
vindication of my friends' judgment.
</p>

<p>
Thinking I had done all I could, I said good-bye
to General Hooker, who asked no questions, went
back to New York, made a full oral report to
Mr. Gay, and asked him whether I was to write a
statement for publication.  He considered a while,
then said:
</p>

<p>
"No, it is a case where the truth can do only
harm.  It is not for the public interest that the
public should know the army is demoralized, or
know that Hooker must go, or know that no successor
to him can yet be named.  Write an editorial,
keep to generalities, and forget most of what you
have told me."
</p>

<p>
I obeyed orders.  But the orders were given
forty-odd years ago.  Such interest as the matter
has is now historical, and so, for the first time,
I make public a part, and only a part, of what I
learned in that month of May, 1863, on the banks
of the Rappahannock.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><br />
THE NEW YORK DRAFT RIOTS IN 1863&mdash;NOTES ON JOURNALISM
</h3>

<p>
One more battle I saw, known as the Draft
Riots of 1863.  I arrived in New York on
the Monday evening, and journeyed south through
the city by the light of the Roman Catholic Orphan
Asylum in flames; a stray negro or two hanging
to a lamp-post here and there.  This was the flank
movement of the Rebellion; an attempt not only
to prevent the enforcement of the draft, which
President Lincoln had too long delayed, but to
compel the Unionist forces to return northward
for the defence of their homes.  A mad scheme,
yet for near four days New York was in possession
of the mob.  I never understood why, since a
couple of good regiments would at any moment
have restored order, as the event showed.  For
want of them New York had to defend itself, and
did it rather clumsily, enduring needless disasters
and losses both of property and life.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Tribune</i> office was marked for destruction
but was armed and garrisoned and only once did
the mob effect an entrance.  Then they swept
into the counting-house on the ground floor and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
made a bonfire of such papers as they found.
For a moment there was danger, but the police
came up from the Spruce Street station, the rioters
fled and the fire was put out.  Upstairs in the
editorial rooms we knew nothing about it till it
was all over.  Afterward a better watch was kept.
Friends of <i>The Tribune</i> volunteered, and there was
no lack of men; nor were the police again careless.
</p>

<p>
Another rush was stopped by the police in the
square.  As I sat at my window looking on the
City Hall I saw this Rebel effort.  But the police
broke the solid mass of rioters as cleverly as it
could have been done in Paris, where such matters
are understood better than anywhere else in the
world.  Once scattered, these ruffians became easy
victims.  The police did not spare them.  I not
only saw, but heard.  I heard the tap, tap, of the
police clubs on the heads of the fugitives.  At each
tap a man went down; and he did not always get
up again.  The street was strewn with the slain.
</p>

<p>
While these incidents were occurring an effort
was made to keep Mr. Greeley away from the office;
partly because he was a man of peace, and we
thought scenes of violence would be unpleasant
to him; partly because he was in danger both in
the office and as he came and went.  But he would
listen to no appeal.  The post of danger was the
Post of duty, and he stood by the ship.  Mr. Greeley's
passion for peace sometimes carried him
far but never showed itself in an ignoble regard
for his personal safety.
</p>

<p>
Sydney Howard Gay's successor in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
managing editorship of <i>The Tribune</i> was
Mr. John Russell Young, who brought with him a new
life and freshness, and something not very far
removed from a genius for journalism: if in the
profession of journalism there be room for genius.
There is room, at any rate, for originality and for
bird's-eye views of things, and for an outlook
upon the world which leaves no important point
uncovered.  There is room for courage and for
quickness of perception and for an intuitive
knowledge of what is news and what is not.  All these
qualities Mr. Young had.  That the end of his
relation with <i>The Tribune</i> was less happy than the
beginning offers no reason, to my mind, for denying
him the tribute which is his due.
</p>

<p>
It seems hard to believe that in 1866, in the
early summer, the first news of the Austro-Prussian
war came to us in New York by ship.  But
so it was.  Mr. Young walked into my room one
morning with a slip of paper in his hand from the
news bureau at, I think, Quarantine, announcing
the Prussian declaration of war, June 18th, and
the advance of the Prussian forces.  I should
like you to take the first steamer to Europe,
remarked Mr. Young, and walked out again.
It was a Monday.  The next steamer was the
Cunarder <i>China</i>, from Boston to Liverpool via
Queenstown, on the Wednesday.  I sailed accordingly,
and on reaching Queenstown was met by a
telegram announcing the Austrian defeat at Sadowa,
or, as the Prussians prefer to call it, Königgrätz,
July 3rd.  The war was over.  There were other
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
military operations, but an armistice was agreed
to July 22nd, and the preliminaries of peace were
signed at Nikolsburg, July 26th.
</p>

<p>
On the following day, July 27th, 1866, the laying
of the new Atlantic cable, the first by which
messages from the public were transmitted, was
successfully completed by the <i>Great Eastern</i>, and on
the 28th a friendly message from the Queen was
sent to the President of the United States.  The
President was Mr. Andrew Johnson, and it took
him two days to reply.  It would have made a
difference to us in America if the war news of May
and June could have reached us by cable.  Even
such grave events as Austria's demand for the
demobilization of the Prussian Army, so far
back as April, and the proceedings in the Federal
Diet at Frankfort in June, made no great
impression on American opinion.  I suppose we were
already in that state of patriotic isolation when
events in Europe seemed to us like events in an
ancient world.  The Austro-Prussian conflict was
not much more to masses of Americans than
the Peloponnesian War.  Nor, in truth, did news
from abroad by mail ever present itself with the
suddenness and authority it derived from the
cable.  It came by mail in masses.  It came by
cable with the peremptory brevity which arrested
attention.  The home telegraph was diffuse.  It
was the cable which first taught us to condense.
A dispatch from London was not, in the
beginning, much more than a flash of lightning;
and went into print as it came, without being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
"written up"; and was ten times the more
effective.
</p>

<p>
I had gone on from London to Berlin, and it
was in Berlin that the news came of a break in
the peace negotiations and the sudden arrest of
the homeward march of the Prussian troops which
had begun August 1st.  I sent a dispatch to <i>The
Tribune</i> announcing this, and hinting at the renewal
of hostilities as a possible consequence.  The
news came from a source which was a guarantee
of its truth; and true it was.  But the diplomatic
difficulty was soon adjusted and again the
Prussian columns flowed steadily northward.  This
message, which for the moment was sufficiently
startling, was, I think, the first news dispatch
which went by cable.  It ran to near one hundred
words, and the cost of it was just short of £100,
or $500.  The rate from London to New York
was then twenty shillings a word.  We wasted no
words at that price.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weaver was then manager of the Anglo-American
Telegraph Company, a man who thought
it good policy to coerce the public.  He
understood much about cable business; not much about
human nature.  He considered himself, and for
the time being he was, at the head of a monopoly.
People who desired to send messages by cable to
America must do so upon his terms or not at all.
It never seemed to occur to him that there might
be such a thing as a prohibitory rate, or that a
business could not be developed to the greatest
advantage by driving away customers.  He was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
quite happy if he could wring an extra sovereign
from the sender.  He thought it a good stroke
to compel each sender of a message to add the
word "London" to his signature.  It was
another twenty shillings in the treasury of the
company.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Weaver enacted many vexatious restrictive
laws the discredit of which fell in great measure
upon Mr. Cyrus Field and other directors of the
Anglo-American Telegraph Company.  It was
Mr. Weaver's business to make rules.  It was the
business of the public to obey them.  At that
time there was between the public and the
Anglo-American company no direct intercourse.  We
were obliged to hand in our messages over the
counter of one of the two inland telegraph
companies, which between them had a monopoly;
the British and Magnetic and the Electric.
Mr. Weaver sat in solitary state in Telegraph Street.
You approached his office as you would approach
a shrine; a temple of some far-off deity.  During
the next few years I had often to discuss matters
with Mr. Weaver, whose regulations embarrassed
and delayed Press messages.  He was opposed to
all concessions to the Press.  He framed a code
under which Press messages at a reduced rate were
dealt with as he chose.  He would give us no
assurance as to when he would begin or when
complete the transmission of such messages.  He
would interrupt the transmission of them in a
purely arbitrary way, so that the first half
of a message might reach New York for next
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
morning's paper and the last half for the day
after.
</p>

<p>
At last there came a crisis.  I had filed an
account of the Oxford-Harvard four-oared race
from Putney to Mortlake, a column and a half
long, in good time for next day's <i>Tribune</i>.  It
did not appear till the day following.  I had gone
with it myself to the City, and handed in my
dispatch over the counter of the British and
Magnetic office in Threadneedle Street.  The office of
the Anglo-American was but two minutes distant.
My inquiries about the delay were met with civil
evasions.  The Anglo- people said they sent on
the dispatch as soon as they got it.  The British
and Magnetic people said it had been forwarded
to the Anglo- "in the ordinary course of business."  Under
that specious phrase lurked the mischief.
It came out after much pressure that, in the
ordinary course of business and by a rule of the
Magnetic Company, every dispatch for the cable must
be copied before it was sent on to the Anglo-.
The staff in attendance when I committed my
message to the Magnetic consisted of a boy at
the counter.  It was his duty to copy the dispatch
when not otherwise engaged.  He completed his
copy early the next morning.  This was finally
admitted.  I then saw Mr. Weaver and put all I
had to say into two sentences.  First, the delayed
dispatch would not be paid for, since it was the
Anglo- which made itself responsible for the delay
by refusing to receive the message direct from the
sender.  Second, unless this rule was abolished
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
I would notify <i>The Tribune</i> that it was useless
to forward messages from London, and advise the
editor to direct their discontinuance.
</p>

<p>
Then came a curious thing.  Mr. Weaver
having reflected on this ultimatum for some thirty
seconds, said:
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Smalley, I will agree to your proposal on
one condition&mdash;that you tell nobody you are
allowed to hand in your messages to us.  We do
not intend to alter our rule.  We make an
exception in your case."
</p>

<p>
I do not suppose Mr. Weaver was aware that
he was giving me a great advantage or that he
meant to give it.  But, although the copying
regulation of the Magnetic was abolished, direct
access to the Anglo- was a great security and a
great saving of precious time.  It was to mean in
the following year of 1870 that dispatches could be
sent through to New York as filed, and in time for
the regular morning issue, which otherwise would
have arrived, in whole or in part, late.  It was
one among several causes to which was due the
success of <i>The Tribune</i> in the early months of the
Franco-German War.  The fact did not become
known in the world of journalism till some time
in the late autumn of 1870.  In February, 1870,
the British Government had taken over the inland
telegraphs, and with them the duty of receiving
transatlantic dispatches.  The Government could
have enforced the old rule had it chosen, but it did
not choose.  The executive officer of the Post
Office was Mr. Scudamore, secretary to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
Postmaster-General, who had no good-will to the
Press and none to me.  Probably he knew nothing
about the matter.  But since 1870 the cable offices
have all been thrown open, or special offices opened
for the receipt of messages, and you may now file
cable messages for America in any Post Office or
any cable office.  The English postal telegraph
service is wonderfully good&mdash;far better than any
telegraph service in America&mdash;but I should never
file a Press message in a postal office if within
reach of a cable office.
</p>

<p>
All this is highly technical and I suppose of no
interest to anybody but journalists and telegraph
managers.  But there are other experiences which
I hope may be found worth reading by a less select
audience.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br /><br />
HOW THE PRUSSIANS AFTER SADOWA CAME HOME TO BERLIN
</h3>

<p>
There is much more to say on this subject
of cabling which I touched on, perhaps prematurely,
in the last chapter, but it can wait till
certain incidents in Berlin have been described.
Ever memorable to me was this visit to Berlin
in 1866, and for two things.  I saw something of
the two greatest forces in Prussia, or two of the
three greatest: the Prussian army and Count
Bismarck.  The third, whom I saw, but only saw,
was the King; whom his grandson has since
rechristened William the Great.  The Seven Weeks'
War was just over.  There were Generals of the
army who expected to enter Vienna in triumph,
as, four and a half years later, the German armies
were to enter Paris.  But Count Bismarck had
vetoed this project; by no means desiring to leave
an indelible scar of defeat and humiliation on a
kindred German capital.  He wished, and the
King wished, that in the future, and in the near
future, Berlin and Vienna should be friends.  In
the interest of that wise policy the purely military
ambitions of these Generals, the Red Prince
perhaps among them, who were soldiers and nothing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
else, were repressed.  A consolation was allowed
them in the shape of a triumphal re-entry into
Berlin.
</p>

<p>
So on the 20th and 21st of September the garrison
of Berlin and Potsdam, fifty thousand strong,
but dividing their strength between the two days,
marched through the Brandenburger Gate, and
up the Unter den Linden to the Opera Platz.  By
good luck I had rooms in the Hotel du Nord, then
the best hotel in Berlin, midway in the great
avenue of Berlin; and being on the second floor I
could look well over the trees and along almost the
whole stretch of this fine street, a hundred yards
wide.
</p>

<p>
It was such a spectacle as presents itself but
seldom to the human eye, German or other.  All
things considered, it cannot often have been
surpassed.  The whole world was looking on.
For here was Prussia, but three months ago a
second-class European Power, which had suddenly
stepped into the front rank.  So dazzling was her
rise that the Emperor Napoleon, looking out of
the Tuileries windows upon a transformed Central
Europe, was already demanding "compensation"
for Sadowa, and demanding vainly.  The leadership
of Germany had passed in a night from Austria
to Prussia.  The Germanic Confederation had
been dissolved and the North German Confederation,
with Prussia the all-powerful head of it, had
come into existence.  With the refusal of Count
Bismarck to listen to the demands of Napoleon,
Prussia stood out in Central Europe as the German
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
State which at last was to resist all attempts from
beyond the Rhine to impose the will of a French
ruler upon the German people.  It was a Declaration
of Independence; and of something more than
independence.
</p>

<p>
When the head of that great column of victorious
troops emerged from the great Gate, what Berlin
saw was the instrument by which these vast
changes had been brought about.  There were
men of prophetic mind who saw in it the instrument
of greater changes yet to be.  But sufficient
for the day was the glory thereof.  All Berlin was
in the streets; or in this one street; or in the
windows and on the housetops of the Unter den Linden.
As they cheered I did not think the volume of
sound comparable to what one hears in London on
great days of public rejoicing.  There was
rejoicing, of course, and there was enthusiasm, but
it was of the grave German kind; none the less
deep for being less resonant.  I cannot remember
being much impressed by these demonstrations,
nor by the flags and other decorations.  The
Prussian flag, with its black and red, was a less
cheerful piece of bunting than the Tricolour or the
Union Jack.  The Germans have, nevertheless,
ideas of ornament and of art values; perhaps
mid-way between the French, who are supreme in such
matters, and the English, who have no ideas at all
except to hang out all the flags they possess and
trust to luck for harmony and effect.  None the
less was the Unter den Linden garlanded with
banners, and the better houses or larger buildings
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
were glowing with colour and contrasts.  But the
military display was the important thing, and it
was magnificent.
</p>

<p>
The King came first, riding a little in front of
his headquarters staff and of the Generals who
were in his suite.  Whether he might be called
William the Great or not, he was on that day a
kingly figure.  The officers with him numbered, I
should think, perhaps a hundred and fifty, mostly
well mounted, in uniforms which, whatever they
might be singly, were splendid in the mass.  They
were perhaps too splendid.  One would have
liked to see these men in the clothes in which they
had marched and fought; with the stains of war
upon them.  But that, I suppose, would have
been abhorrent to the German mind, and especially
to the German military mind, with its deep devotion
to etiquette and its worship of routine and
all forms of military technique.  But the echoes
of Austrian battlefields had not yet sunk into
silence, and we knew well enough that these were
no holiday warriors.
</p>

<p>
They rode slowly.  When the King and his
staff had passed there came a surprise.  The
procession seemed for one moment to have come
to an end.  There was an open space of perhaps
fifty yards.  In the centre of it rode three men
The three were: Von Roon, Minister of War;
Moltke; and between them Bismarck in a white
uniform as Major of Cuirassiers.  It was when
they came into view that the cheering rose highest.
The King was popular and the greeting of his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
people had been cordial.  But the three men
behind him were the real heroes.  Von Roon had
organized the forces of Prussia; Moltke had guided
them to victory; Bismarck had planned and
brought on the war.  The Carnot of Prussia; the
soldier of all soldiers of Prussia next after the
great Frederick; the brain and will and directing
force of Prussia, these three; and in all Europe
no other three comparable to them, singly or
together.
</p>

<p>
So here they rode, these Three by themselves;
apart, as if all that had gone before and all that
was to come after were there in homage to them.
The King and his headquarters staff were but the
advance-guard to these Three.  The five-and-twenty
thousand troops who followed were but
their rear-guard.  These servants and priceless
possessions of the State were encompassed about by all
that was brilliant and all that was useful in the
State themselves excepted.  They bore themselves
as befitted their services and their places, with a
dignity, a serene disregard of everything but their
duty, which belong to real greatness.  Berlin
hailed them with cheers of a kind which had been
given to no other.  I do not know that any of
the three was precisely what might be called
Popular.  Popularity was not what Von Roon
or Moltke or Bismarck had sought.  But Berlin
knew, and Prussia knew, that but for these three
there would have been no day of victory for the
Fatherland.
</p>

<p>
The troops came past in the formation known
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
as company front, and as the Prussian companies
were a hundred strong or more, the effect was
admirable.  Berlin was thronged with soldiers for
days after this, and the individual Prussian soldier
was not then a very imposing object.  He was
well set up, but he and his uniform were not always
on good terms; in short, he was too often slovenly
or slouching.  He had, moreover, a stiffness of
bearing which reminded you of Heine's bitter
account of him in earlier days; that "he looked
as if he had swallowed the ramrod with which he
had been thrashed."  But in the mass you saw
nothing slovenly, and the stiffness perhaps helped
his officers to dress that company front in a straight
line across the broad street.  The front was, in
fact, perfection, and so was the marching, and as
these bodies of drilled men moved up the Linden
they looked like what they had proved themselves,
irresistible.  They swept on with a movement as
of some great natural force.  Regiment after
regiment swung past.  There was never a break or
halt.  The machine was in its best working order.
The men carried their heads high, crowned with
victory.  And so the tide of war poured through
this peaceful street.
</p>

<p>
The Prussian uniform was not a brilliant one.
In point of mere costume these troops were not
comparable to many others.  The Austrians were
far more smartly dressed; and the English, and
the French.  But this blue and red looked
workmanlike, while as for ornament&mdash;well, what
ornament was needed beyond the word Sadowa, which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
might have been, but was not, embroidered on
the collars of their tunics?  You saw also that
this was a citizen army: the German people were
in these ranks, as the Prussian people.  The words
have since become almost convertible, though there
are millions of Germans who will not agree to that.
</p>

<p>
The regimental officers were well enough mounted
and, so far as one could judge from a parade
like this, were good horsemen.  They sat well
down in their saddles.  A good seat and good
hands go together, or ought to go together, but
do not always, and the hands seemed heavy if a
horse turned restive.  But another thing became
clear as you looked.  The officers were of the
elect.  The Prussian aristocracy was in the saddle.
There has never been a time since the Great
Elector of Brandenburg when it was not in the
saddle, actually and figuratively.  To adopt
Bismarck's phrase at a much later day, in a great
speech at Jena, this country of Prussia has never
been ruled from below.  It was not in 1866.  Nor
have the Junkers and the nobility of Prussia ever
failed to pay with their persons when the need arose.
In that murderous cavalry charge at Mars-la-Tour,
the ranks were crowded with the sons of Princes,
and Dukes, and Counts, and all the rest; they
rode, no small part of them, to death, and knew
they were riding to death, but no thought of rank
or riches stayed them, nor did any one falter.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible not to think of these later things
as the memories of these September days in 1866
come back.  I looked on then at the beginnings
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
of what was foreordained to happen.  This was
the army, these were the very men who were to
close about Sedan in that other September of 1870.
Long after that I was to see them again in the
Opera Platz and Unter den Linden when the King
who now rides with his grave gallantry of bearing
at their head was to be buried, on one of the coldest
and perhaps the blackest day Berlin ever saw.
The splendour had departed.  The triumph of 1866
had given way to mourning and gloom.  And on
the architrave of the Brandenburg Thor, draped
and shrouded, like all Berlin, in black, stood out
in white letters the last greeting of Berlin to its
old-time King, "Vale, Senex Imperator."

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br /><br />
A TALK WITH COUNT BISMARCK IN 1866
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
By one of those pieces of good fortune which
descend only upon the undeserving, I came
to know Count Bismarck before I left Berlin.  I
was advised to present my letter at the Landtag,
and as the Count was said to be in the House, I
sent it in.  He came out to the ante-chamber where
I was waiting, and there for the first time I looked
into the pale blue eyes whence had flashed the
lightnings that had riven the power of Austria
on the field of Sadowa.  Now they had a kindly
and welcoming look in them.  But, said Count
Bismarck:
</p>

<p>
"I have not a moment.  A debate is on, and I
am to speak at once.  Come to my house in the
Wilhelmstrasse at half-past ten to-night, and we
can have a talk.  Meantime you might like to
hear the debate."
</p>

<p>
And he called to an official to take me into the
Chamber, shook hands again, and away he went.
I heard his speech, marvelled at the sight of a
Parliamentary chief in full military uniform;
marvelled at the tone of authority, which also was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
military; marvelled again at the brevity and
directness of the orator who took no thought of
rhetoric and hardly cared to convince, but rather
to command.  It was the oratory of the master
of many legends.  True, the four years' conflict
between him and the Prussian Parliament was
over, but true also that on both Parliament and
Minister that conflict had left a mark.  In his
voice there was still a challenge, and in the silence
of the Chamber still something sullen.  He had
won.  They had lost in a struggle upon which,
as Herr Loewe told me, they ought never to have
entered; would never have entered had they known.
Loewe and his party of so-called Liberals confessed
themselves not only beaten but wholly in the
wrong.
</p>

<p>
At half-past ten I rang at the outer door&mdash;which
was more like a gate&mdash;of the palace in the
Wilhelmstrasse.  It was opened by a soldier who
asked my name, and when he heard it told me
I was expected and asked me to follow him.  I
was taken upstairs to a large empty room on the
first floor.  In a moment out came Count
Bismarck's famous <i>adlatus</i>, Herr Lothar Bücher.
The Count was engaged with the Minister of War
but if I could wait would see me presently.  I
waited ten minutes.  Again the door to the left
opened, and forth came Von Roon, the mighty
organizer of war, himself of course a soldier since
in Prussia everybody who counted in affairs of
State was a soldier, and still is.  You had need
to visit Berlin in those warlike days to understand
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
what was meant by the phrase that Prussia was a
camp.  Then you had need to visit it again in
time of peace to understand that whether in peace
or war Prussia was still a camp, and as much in
peace as in war.  What it is now I cannot say.
I have not been in Berlin these last fifteen years,
but between 1866 and 1893 I was there many times,
and every time it was a camp.  The garrison of
Berlin and Potsdam was never, I think, less than
40,000 men.  The streets of Berlin were always
thronged with officers, and on the broad
sidewalks of the Unter den Linden or the
Friedrichstrasse there was scarce room for anybody else.
The youngest lieutenant wanted all of it to
himself.  To each other these officers were civility
itself but the civilian had no rights they were
bound to respect.
</p>

<p>
I had already seen something of this all-pervading
military spirit and military supremacy,
and sat reflecting on it in this great <i>salon</i> where
I waited for Count Bismarck to be at leisure.
When Herr von Roon came out he recognized me,
I suppose, as a stranger, and, civilian though I
was, gave me the greeting he thought due to
Count Bismarck's guest, which I returned.  There
was almost a halt as he strode past; his face was
turned to me, and I could read in it the stern
record of a long conflict; of vast responsibilities
and years of unceasing toil; a rugged face enough
but the light of victory in his eye.  He, too, had
fought and won.  Curiously enough, among the
men I met at that time in Berlin, the man who,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
Bismarck excepted, seemed to have most of
the statesman in him, with the statesman's
civic virtues and traits, was this Minister of War.
Not because he was Minister in the sense in
which an English Secretary of State for War is
Minister.  The English War Minister is never a
soldier; he is a Parliamentary chief, and his
authority over the army denotes the supremacy
of Parliament over the whole military hierarchy
from commander-in-chief down to the drummer
boy.
</p>

<p>
But of Parliamentary supremacy there had
been for these last four years in Prussia none
whatever.  The Minister of War was not responsible
to Parliament; he never has been; he is not
now.  He was then responsible to the King of
Prussia, as he is now to the German Emperor.
When, in May, 1863, the Chamber protested to
the King that the attitude of the Ministry to
Parliament was arbitrary and unconstitutional
(as it was), the King made answer that the
Ministry possessed his confidence, and sent the
Parliament about its business.  That is, he prorogued
Parliament, announced that he would govern for
the present without a Parliament; and as matters
did not mend and the Chamber again in December
refused to vote a war budget, the King dissolved
it.  Parliamentary government existed at that
time in Prussia under the constitution, but in
name only.
</p>

<p>
These reflections were cut short by the reopening
of the door, and Count Bismarck entered.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
Still in uniform, nor did I ever see him except in
uniform, whether in public or private, till I visited
him in his home at Friedrichsruh in 1893, where
he wore a black frock-coat and black trousers,
crowned, when he went out, by a soft, broad-brimmed
grey felt hat, quite shapeless.  He had,
more than any man I ever met, the manner of the
<i>grand seigneur</i>, in which distinction of bearing
and a grave, even gentle, courtesy went together.
He was sorry, he said, to have kept me waiting,
"but the business of the State, you know, comes
first, and though one crisis is over another
succeeds, and we know not yet what the end is to
be."  This I understood to refer not to Austria, for the
Treaty of Prague had been signed in August, but
to France, where the Emperor was brooding over
his lost prestige and lost hold on Southern
Germany, and was meditating demands which might
compensate him for the loss of the power of meddling
with matters which were none of his business.
</p>

<p>
As he said this we walked into his private room,
or cabinet, the very centre of the spider's web;
a comfortable, plain, workmanlike little room;
a writing-desk the chief piece of furniture, large
enough to fill the whole of the further corner; a
sideboard opposite, a small table with ash trays,
a few chairs, and that was all.  The curtains were
drawn; the room, German fashion, seemed a
trifle close, and as if old Frederick William's
Tobacco Parliament had been held here all these
last hundred and fifty years or more.  There
was a rug in the centre which had to do duty for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
the carpet which in Germany, as elsewhere on the
Continent, never covers the whole floor.
</p>

<p>
As we were sitting down, the Count behind his
desk, a door opened, opposite to the one by which
we had entered, and there appeared a lady whom
I had never seen; the Countess Bismarck.  When
she saw me she said to her husband:
</p>

<p>
"You have not been in bed for three nights.
I hope you don't mean to sit up again."
</p>

<p>
Of course I rose, saying, "At any rate, he shall
not sit up for me."  But the Count laughed, came
out from behind his desk, took me by the shoulders,
thrust me down into the chair again, all with
an air of kindly authority not easy to describe,
and said:
</p>

<p>
"Sit where you are.  I want to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
As I thought it over afterward I supposed
Count Bismarck had some object in mind other
than the pleasure of my conversation.  He knew
that I was the representative of <i>The Tribune</i>; my
letter to him had stated that.  He knew what the
position and power of <i>The Tribune</i> were, and
especially of its influence with the Germans in
America.  And it seemed to me that, in view of
the relations between the Germans at home and
the Germans beyond the seas, he thought it might
be worth while that his view of the situation
should be put before the Germans in America,
and before the Americans also, in an authentic
though not an authoritative way.  Count
Bismarck did not say that.  It was my conjecture,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
upon which I acted to a certain extent as I will
explain more fully by and by.
</p>

<p>
Countess Bismarck looked on at this performance
which she plainly did not like, but presently
smiled and said to her husband: "Well, if you
will sit up you must have something to drink,"
went to the sideboard, mixed a brandy and soda,
took it to him, put the glass to his lips, and stood
by him to see that he drank the whole, which he
did with no visible reluctance.  He handed the
empty tumbler to his wife and thanked her.  She
put her arm about him, kissed him, looked at
me reproachfully but amiably, and vanished.  A
truly domestic, truly German, altogether charming
little scene.
</p>

<p>
Many years later, after Count Bismarck had
become Prince Bismarck and a greater figure in
Germany than the world had seen, I met Princess
Bismarck again at a dinner in Homburg given
by Mr. William Walter Phelps, American Minister
at Berlin.  Mr. Phelps had long been a friend of
the Bismarck family and on easy terms with the
head of that family, who liked and respected him.
It was a case of sympathy between opposites.
No contrast could be more complete than the
contrast between Prince Bismarck and Mr. Phelps;
but their relations were, as so often happens, all
the more friendly for that reason.  I was presented
to the Princess, and after dinner inquired whether
she remembered this midnight incident in the
Wilhelmstrasse.  She asked me to describe it, and
I told her what had happened.  She had wholly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
forgotten it.  I asked her if I might some day
narrate the story.  "I don't see why you shouldn't,"
she answered.  Years after that I again saw
the Princess at Friedrichsruh, and she asked
whether I had ever repeated my tale.  I said
no, but that I still meant to avail myself of her
permission, as I now do.
</p>

<p>
The Princess thought, I imagine, she would like
to see the Prince portrayed in this intimate way
and in this relation to his wife.  Her life had
always been lived in and for his.  She knew well
what the world thought; to the world he was always
the Iron Chancellor.  But in private life he was
the affectionate loyal husband to whom one woman
had devoted all she had&mdash;all her love, truth,
worship&mdash;an adoration which perhaps not many men
have deserved or received from any woman.
</p>

<p>
There is much in Bismarck's <i>Love Letters</i>&mdash;which
are hardly love letters&mdash;about his wife and
much in other Bismarck books, notably in Sidney
Whitman's <i>Personal Reminiscences</i>, the best of
them all.  The Princess will ever live as an amiable
figure, and if she had not been that would still
live as the wife of the one great German of his
time; as the woman who had known how to
captivate a fancy once supposed to be wayward,
and to make it and him her own.  The quality
which distinguished her was sweetness or nature,
which she never lost during a life harassed by
many solicitudes and vexed by illness.

</p>

<p>
The Countess von Bismarck having departed
out of the little room, the King's Minister plunged
at once into his subject, which was nothing less
than the history of the last four years during
which he had ruled over Prussia.  Much of what
he said I repeated in <i>The Tribune</i> no very long
time after.  All that he said, or all that I could
remember, I put down in writing that night before
I slept.  It contained, however, so much that
obviously was not meant for print and could never
be printed that, after using as much as I thought
could properly be published, I destroyed my
manuscript.  I had said to Count Bismarck as I left
that he knew he had been talking to a journalist
and yet had said many things he could not
wish made known to the public.  He laughed
and answered: "Well, it is your business to
distinguish."
</p>

<p>
It is, therefore, still my business to distinguish.
I may perhaps say a little more than I could while
both the Emperor and the Prince were alive, but
not much.  For, in truth, I have never quite
understood why confidences cease to be confidences
because those who imparted them or those whom
they concern are dead.  A man who quits this
world leaves his reputation, if he has any, behind
him.  Indiscretions may affect his memory as they
might have affected his living fame.  In this case
they would exalt Count Bismarck's fame; but
it might be at the expense of others whom he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
no desire to belittle.  So I keep for the most part
to generalities.
</p>

<p>
Of the King he spoke with astonishing freedom,
yet never a word to injure the sovereign whom
he served.  I will quote once more a sentence I
have repeated before now:
</p>

<p>
"You are a Republican, and you cannot fully
understand the loyalty I cherish to a King to
whose ancestors my ancestors have been loyal
for hundreds of years."
</p>

<p>
Yet it comes to this&mdash;and of this truth History
has long since taken account&mdash;that between
Count Bismarck and his august master there was
a long-continuing conflict.  If the King had won
there would have been no Austro-Prussian War,
nor any Franco-German War, nor any German
Confederation, nor any Germany as we know
Germany to-day.  When, therefore, the present
German Emperor puts forward his grandfather
as the author of these changes, he is making for
his grandfather a false claim.  While he was still
Prince William of Prussia he said:
</p>

<p>
"Whenever I hear a great event in my grandfather's
reign discussed I never hear his name
mentioned, but always Bismarck's.  When I come
to the throne it is my name you will hear as
the author of the policies and deeds of my
reign."
</p>

<p>
William the Second has kept that pledge, but
that is no reason why he should try to rewrite the
history of his grandfather's time or to rob Prince
Bismarck of the renown which belongs to him and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
which the world awards him.  Powerful as he is,
he is not powerful enough for that.
</p>

<p>
This is a digression, but it will serve to bring
out the main fact that there was a contest between
the King and Bismarck in 1866, and that not the
King but Bismarck came out triumphant.  In
the long war with Parliament the King and his
Minister were together, and the King was as
loyal to his Minister as the Minister was to the
King.  But when the critical moment came it
still has to be said that Bismarck's was the
seeing eye and the deciding voice, and his, not the
King's, was the directing mind.
</p>

<p>
Over the heads of the Parliament and people
of Prussia, and against the wish of the King, who
only at the last moment and by one last argument
had been persuaded to consent, did Bismarck
pursue his way.
</p>

<p>
"It was not," said Bismarck, "till I had
convinced the King that his honour as a soldier was
involved that he would agree to the war with
Austria.  No political argument moved him.  The
vision of a united Germany with himself at the
head of a German Confederation did not dazzle him.
</p>

<p>
"'Austria is my brother,' he said; 'the war
would be fratricidal.  The Emperor and I are
bound together by many ties, by many interests;
above all by affection and by loyalty.  I should
think it treacherous to attack a sovereign who
has given me many proofs of good-will and to
I have given pledges.  Nothing will induce
to do it.'"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Yet," continued Bismarck, "he had allowed
me to take step after step, each one of which led
inevitably to war.  In the long conflict with the
Parliament he was with me.  Only by his support
was that conflict maintained or victory possible.
No money was voted for four years.  We laid
hands on the public revenues, but the Government
had to be carried on in part by money supplied
out of that Royal Treasure Fund which for generations
the Kings of Prussia have hoarded for kingly
purposes.  The preparations for war were
nourished from the same source.  The war with
Denmark was paid for to a certain extent out of the
same royal purse.  The Landtag never assented
to the Schleswig-Holstein enterprise nor would
vote a solitary thaler to carry it on.  Before that,
when I became Minister, in September, 1862, my
first act was to announce to the Chamber that
I proposed to govern without a budget.  The
Chamber protested against that as unconstitutional,
which of course it was.  Six months later
the Chamber invited the King to dismiss his
Ministers.  He replied that his Ministers had his
confidence, and a week later instead of dismissing
us announced that he proposed to govern without
a Parliament.
</p>

<p>
"All this time I was preparing for war with
Austria after Denmark.  The King must have
known what it all meant, but he did not stay his
hand nor withdraw his confidence from us.  After
the peace with Denmark there was no longer any
reason for military preparations except Austria.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
But the King still allowed me to go on.  In
January, 1865, the Parliament again rejected the
public budget.  The King rejoined by seizing on
the public revenues in the name of the State.  The
public knew nothing of what I had in mind.  The
Parliament knew nothing.  If it had been possible
to take Parliament into my confidence the budget
would have been voted.  The Liberals have
admitted that.  But to take Parliament into my
confidence would have been to take Austria into
my confidence.  It could not be.  It was necessary
to strike suddenly; to strike before Austria could
assemble her reserves, or take advantage of her
immense resources, or bring into line all the
discordant races of that great Empire.
</p>

<p>
"How much did I tell the King?  Well, as much
as was necessary for the time being.  The great
struggle with His Majesty was put off till the
moment of conflict was near; till it was necessary
to throw off the mask.  Besides, you must
consider that I had to deal not only with the King
but with the various Court influences which
surrounded him.  They were almost all hostile to me.
Many of them were very powerful with the King.
I might spend six weeks in coaxing him to assent
to a particular measure.  When he had promised,
in would come some Grand Duchess and in half
an hour undo my six weeks' work."
</p>

<p>
I interrupt the flow of this speech to remark
that, long after this, Prince Bismarck repeated to
the same complaint about grand ducal interventions.
They never ceased.  They were never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
relaxed.  There was no conciliating these great
personages.  They had policies and purposes of
their own, which were never those of Germany
but always of some German principality with
which their personal interests were bound up.
There is nothing so selfish as a second-class
Royalty; a Serenity with a dukedom which a
pocket-handkerchief would cover.
</p>

<p>
Bismarck continued:
</p>

<p>
"In the end Austria played my game for me.
She demanded in April, 1866, the demobilization
of the Prussian forces, which had begun to put
themselves on a war footing in March.  Then I
knew the Lord had delivered her into our hands.
I laid the demand before the King, saying: 'I do
not know whether Your Majesty is prepared to
surrender the command of your army to your
brother of Austria.'  He took fire at once.  Then
it was that he felt his honour as a soldier was
attacked.  From that moment the difficulty was to
restrain him.  We were not quite ready.  It would
have been dangerous to declare war at once.  It
was dangerous, perhaps, to let the moment of the
King's anger pass, lest counsels of peace should
again prevail.  But one risk or the other had to be
taken, and I chose the latter.  Two months later,
June 18th, war was declared, and the King issued
a manifesto to his people which was everything
that could be wished.  All the rest was in the
hands of the God of Battles."
</p>

<p>
Then a pause and a piercing glance, then on he
went:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
</p>

<p>
"After Königgrätz there were the same difficulties.
The King could not at first understand
why this career of victory was to be interrupted.
He was King no longer.  He was Field Marshal,
commanding the forces of Prussia.  He had won
a great battle.  The power of Austria was broken.
Vienna lay at his mercy.  Germany was waiting
to know whether Austria or Prussia was to be her
future master&mdash;well, no, not master, but which of
the two was to be the chief State in Germany
and the true leader of the German people.  What
other sign of supremacy could be so visible, so
convincing, as the Prussian armies in Vienna,
Prussian troops encamped in the Prater, the
Danube bridled and bridged by us Prussians?
When an enemy's capital lay at the victor's
mercy, why should he not enter it?  What great
soldier ever refrained?
</p>

<p>
"Thus," said Bismarck, "spoke the King.  I
ventured to remind His Majesty of his reluctance
to make war on the Emperor of Austria, and to
ask whether, now that he was vanquished, he
wished him to be humiliated also.  That seemed
to touch him.  We talked long.  He was
surrounded by generals and princes who urged him
on, but in the end he came round to my view which
had been his own view before the war.  So here
we are in Berlin and not in Vienna, and please God
we shall all be friends again, and some day there
will be one Germany and not two, or twenty, or
fifty, as in times past and to-day.  The fruits of
our triumph are yet to gather."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
</p>

<p>
Twice during this discourse I had risen to go,
but Bismarck said: "No, I have not finished."  The
third time, it was long past one o'clock, and I
said: "If I don't go now Countess Bismarck will
never let me see you again."  This amused him,
and he remarked: "I suppose you think I am
getting sleepy!"  But sleepy he was not.  He
had talked for near two hours with unquenchable
energy and freshness, and with a force of speech
in which no man was his rival.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br /><br />
AMERICAN DIPLOMACY IN ENGLAND
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
The Ministers and Ambassadors who have
represented the United States in England
have an interest individually and as a body.  So
long a line of men, mostly distinguished, is almost
a dynasty.  Some of them are totally forgotten.
Some are remembered faintly.  Some have left a
lasting impression.  I have known a round dozen
of them.  The public memory is short.  If I say
that to Mr. Charles Francis Adams it was
permitted to do a greater service to his country
abroad than to any American since Franklin&mdash;or
since his grandfather, John Adams, who might
perhaps as a diplomatist be ranked above
Franklin&mdash;if I say this, there are Americans to whom
it will seem doubtful.  But since Adams's greater
service consisted in a just menace of war to
England if she let loose the Alexandra, the current
histories, written in days when every act of
hostility to England was applauded, right or wrong,
have done him justice.  He was right, a thousand
times right, and we cannot remember it too often.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
</p>

<p>
But what Americans ought also to remember
is this, that when Mr. Adams flung his glove in
Lord Russell's face it was done neither from temper
nor impulse.  It was the considered act of a
Minister who had weighed all the chances, who
had made up his mind that open war was better
than covert hostility, and that it belonged to
him to accept the responsibility.  Whether
Mr. Seward would have backed up his Minister may
be a question, had the Minister's "This means
war" been met by Lord Russell with "Then war
it is."  But the British Government knew&mdash;even
Lord Palmerston knew&mdash;they were in the wrong;
and they gave way.  But they gave way only
because Mr. Adams had put the alternative of
war before them.  It was very far from being his
only service or his only triumph, but it was the
greatest of all.
</p>

<p>
It is not too much to say that the diplomatic
fortunes of the United States were in the hands of
the American Minister to Great Britain from 1861
to 1863; and, indeed, to the end of the Civil War.
A weak man, or an incompetent Minister, would
have brought us to the dust.  Adams, of course,
was neither.  He was a match for anybody in his
business as Minister.  He had the intellectual
qualities and he had the personal qualities.
Moreover, he was an Adams.  He belonged to the
governing classes, to one of the few great
American families in whom the traditions and gifts of
government are hereditary.  The philosopher who
divided the population of Massachusetts into
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
men, women, and Adamses made a strictly
scientific distribution.  The Adamses were of that
minority which, under one name or another and
in all countries alike, governs.  It governs none
the less when it sees fit to allow the democracy
to believe itself all-powerful than when it takes
command as an aristocracy.
</p>

<p>
I knew Mr. Adams.  Mr. R. H. Dana, Jr., who
smoothed so many paths for me, gave me a letter
to him.  This was in 1867.  The days of tumult
and conflict were over.  His great work was done,
but he remained Minister till 1868.  The legation
was then in Portland Place.  Mr. Moran was
Secretary of Legation; an excellent official whose
service in that position in London lasted seventeen
years, and was finally rewarded by promotion to
Lisbon as Minister.  He was a good watchdog.
A secretary, of whatever rank, has to be that.
Like Horatius, he has to keep the bridge, albeit,
against his own countrymen.  They are the
Volscians.  When I asked to see Mr. Adams
Mr. Moran very properly wished to know why, and
when I produced Mr. Dana's letter Mr. Moran
seemed to think it was addressed to him, and not
till I had explained that it was Mr. Dana's, who
was Mr. Adams's friend, and that I had no other
business than to present this letter, did Mr. Moran's
vigilance relax.  We became friends afterwards.
</p>

<p>
When I saw the Minister he departed a little
from his official manner, greeted me kindly, and
said: "You have brought me a very strong letter.
What can I do for you?"  When I thanked him
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
and said I wanted nothing, he relaxed a little
further, laughed a little, and observed that most
of his countrymen who called at the legation had
an object.  He talked with a singular precision;
his was a mind of precision, like the modern rifle,
equally good at short range and long if you adjust
the sights.  But good as was his talk, what
impressed you most was the silent power of the man;
the force in reserve, the solidity and the delicate
temper of the metal.
</p>

<p>
I dwell a moment on the relations between travelling
Americans and their legation or embassy&mdash;which
to the untravelled may seem unimportant&mdash;because,
now as much as ever and perhaps more
than ever, the duties of a Minister, of an
Ambassador, of the embassy, are so often misunderstood
by that portion of the public from America which
is intent on immediate admission to Buckingham
Palace.  I have known many secretaries since
Mr. Moran's time.  They have been, as a rule,
willing and competent, really desirous to be of
service to their countrymen.
</p>

<p>
There is no other embassy than the American on
which such demands are made as on ours in
London and in Paris, and to some extent in
other capitals.  These demands are addressed
first of all to the Ambassador or Ambassadress.
I will take a single instance.  There is each year
a large number of Americans who desire to be
presented at Court, and who think it the duty
of the Ambassador to arrange for their presentation.
Many of these applications are sent by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
letter well in advance of their coming.  There
are hundreds of such applications&mdash;literally
hundreds; four or five hundred this year from American
ladies who thought themselves, and were, worthy
to appear before the King and Queen at one of the
three Courts presently to be held.  The number
of presentations which the Ambassadress is
entitled to make at each of the three Courts is four.
That is a rule, an ordinance of the King who has
the sole authority in such matters.  Sometimes,
in some special case, upon reason assigned, the
rule is relaxed and a presentation may be made
outside of it.  But all such requests are rigidly
scrutinized and the margin is very narrow.  The
exceptions are units.
</p>

<p>
In these circumstances, with four hundred
candidates for four presentations, what is an unhappy
Ambassadress to do?  The American, used to the
easy ways prevailing at the White House, supposes
they must be equally easy at Buckingham Palace;
or that, upon a word from the American Ambassador,
in these days of pleasant Anglo-American
relations, all doors will fly open.  If they do not,
each one of the four hundred regards hers, as a
case for exceptional favour.  She has come three
thousand or four or six thousand miles in order to
lend the distinction of her republican presence to
these royal functions.  What is an Ambassador
for if not to give effect to these good intentions?
The Lord Chamberlain stands at the door with a
drawn sword, but is an American Ambassador
to be intimidated by a mere officer of the Royal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
Household?  It is in vain to answer that even a
King has a right to say whom he can receive and
whom he cannot.  <i>Le charbonnier est maître
chez soi</i>, but not, they think, the King of England.
</p>

<p>
The perplexities arising out of this American
eagerness to witness these royal splendours are
innumerable.  The resentment arising out of
inevitable refusals is a burden which every
Ambassador has to bear; and every secretary too.
Grievances are of many kinds.  It is not so many years
since an American Minister was asked by cable&mdash;almost
ordered&mdash;by a distinguished fellow-countryman
to engage lodgings for him in London.  It is
not many more since an eminent statesman,
arriving after Levees and Drawing-rooms were over,
desired a secretary to arrange that he and his
family should take tea with the Queen at Windsor
Castle.
</p>

<p>
These are cases occurring not in musical comedy
but in actual life.  There are others, relating not
to royalty but to society, and to various forms of
English life.  But it is already only too evident
that the diplomatic duties of an Ambassador are
not his only anxieties.  The others, so far as I
know anything about them, have always been
borne cheerfully.  Everything has been done for
the American in London that could be done.  He
is taken care of to an extent that the Briton abroad
never is, nor ever expects to be.  But to all human
effort there is a limit.

</p>

<p class="t3">
MR. JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY
</p>

<p>
Since Mr. Adams's retirement in 1868 we have
had three Ambassadors whose ability as diplomatists
entitles them to places in the front rank.
If you take account of other kinds of ability and
of Ministers, there are more than three.  Mr. Motley
was a brilliant historian whose "Rise of
the Dutch Republic" and "History of the United
Netherlands" gave him a lasting European reputation
and added distinction to American literature.
But neither his six years of service as Minister to
Austria, 1861-7, nor his year and a half in England,
1869-70, proved him a great diplomatist.
</p>

<p>
Austria was not then, and is not now, of the
first importance from an American point of view.
We respect her wise old Emperor.  We do not,
I think, agree with Mr. Gladstone in saying you
can nowhere put your finger on the map and say,
"Here Austrian rule has been beneficent."  She
never was a model to us and is not now.  But since
we like courage, and clear-sighted decision, and
the recognition of facts, and like the men who
have these gifts, we have not joined very heartily
in the European outcry against the Austrian
annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  We are
a world-power for certain purposes only.  We
stand aloof from purely European complications.
They are, as a rule, no affair of ours.  We learned
to our cost, or possibly our mortification, not very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
long ago, that Austria, "effete" or not, was capable
of giving us a lesson in diplomacy; or, at least, in
diplomatic etiquette; by which we, or our late
President, may or may not have profited.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Motley, though he wrote excellent dispatches
and made no diplomatic or social mistakes
in that difficult Austrian capital, had not the
smooth temper or the patient arts which are
essential to success at critical moments.  He was
impetuous, explosive, rhetorical; prone to interpret
his instructions in the light of his own wishes
or convictions.  Socially he was a force, even in
Vienna, because of his personal charm, his
distinction of appearance and of manner.  Socially
speaking, he was an aristocrat.  He was the first
American Minister in London to establish himself
in a house suitable to the dignity of the post, Lord
Yarborough's, in Arlington Street.  He was known
to be Count Bismarck's friend.  That of itself
gave him a kind of celebrity, for Count Bismarck
was then a comparatively unfamiliar personage in
England, where the outlook of the average man
on the Continental horizon is not wide.
</p>

<p>
One of the first questions Count Bismarck asked
me when I first talked with him in the Wilhelmstrasse
in 1866 was whether I knew Motley.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to Vienna?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then of course you will see Motley.  Be sure
you give him a message from me&mdash;a warm message.
I have never forgotten our university days
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
together at Göttingen; our friendship.  He knows
that, but tell him again.  And tell him I hope to
see him in Berlin before he goes home."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, there came into the eyes of the
Iron Chancellor a look I had not seen before.
The steel-blue softened into the blue of the skies;
after rain, as the Chinese say.  His friendship for
Motley was an affectionate friendship.  Later, I
talked with Motley about Bismarck and of course
delivered my message.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Motley, "we were boys together
at Göttingen.  His was a different life from mine.
I dare say you have heard the stories about young
Bismarck's exploits.  In those matters he was
like most students of his time and of his class.
The Prussian Junker is a being by himself.  But
we became friends, and friends we have remained.
We don't meet often, but the friendship has never
died out nor decayed."
</p>

<p>
Another thing made Motley far otherwise
popular in England; his passionate Americanism.
Mr. Price Collier is of opinion that Englishmen
do not like Americans.  I do not agree with
Mr. Collier, but, whether they do or not, they like
an American to be an American.  They liked
Mr. Motley because his patriotism burst forth in
all companies and at all times.  It made him, or
tended to make him, reluctant to compromise on
any question where the interests of his country were
concerned.  But compromise is of the essence of
diplomacy; most of all as between the greatest
Powers of the World.  If nobody ever yielded
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
anything, negotiations could end only in surrender
or in war; the two things which it is the business
of diplomacy to avoid.  Nothing Motley ever did
in diplomacy was of such service to his country
as his two letters to <i>The Times</i>, early in the Civil
War, and his memorable outburst in the Athenæum
Club.  To write the letters he violated the
unwritten law of diplomacy, for he was then
Minister to Austria.  To make the Athenæum
speech&mdash;for it was nothing less&mdash;he departed
from the other unwritten law which makes a club
neutral ground, and makes anything like an
oration impossible.
</p>

<p>
But Motley had among other qualities the
quality of courage.  His invective in the
Athenæum against the very classes among whose
representatives he stood was magnificent, and it came
very near being war, or a declaration of war.  He
would keep no terms with the men who were
enemies of his country in such a crisis as that.
If it had been anybody but Motley who thundered
against the ignorance and prejudice of the
Confederate allies who then gave the tone to English
society, I imagine the Committee of the Club
might have taken notice.  But Motley fascinated
while he rebuked.  When he had done denouncing
them as renegades to English ideas and enemies
to liberty, they liked him the better.  I can think
of no incident so like this as Plimsoll's defiance
of the House of Commons, when he rushed into
the middle of the floor and charged his
fellow-members with sacrificing the lives of English

sailors to the cupidity of English ship-owners,
and so compelled the House to adopt the load-line.
</p>

<p>
History has taken note of Plimsoll's exploit.
Motley's may never appear in pages which aim at
historical dignity.  But to this day, when near
half a century has passed, Motley's is still
remembered; still spoken of; still admired.  There are
men living who heard him.  The English do not
entirely like being reminded of their mistakes
about us at that period, but they bear no malice
against the man whose admonition did much to
bring them to their senses.  On the contrary,
through all these forty-odd years, you might have
heard Motley spoken of with admiring good-will.
</p>

<p>
Before all things, he loved his own country.
Next to his own country, <i>longo intervallo</i>, he loved
England, and it may be doubted whether we have
ever sent a Minister, or anybody else to England
whom the English themselves have loved as they
loved Motley.  His deep blue eyes shine starlike
across all that interval of years.  He carried his
head high.  His stature was well above the usual
stature of men.  In all companies he was
conspicuous for beauty and for his bearing.  And
from the confusion and forgetfulness of that
crowded period he still emerges, a living force, a
brilliant memory; an American, as Dean Stanley
said of him, "in whom the aspirations of America
and the ancient culture of Europe were united."
</p>

<p>
There is supposed to be still a mystery about
his recall by President Grant.  But it is an open-air
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
mystery.  Grant struck at Sumner through
Motley.  Any weapon was thought good enough
to beat Sumner with.  Motley was his friend,
Sumner had made him Minister.  It was deemed
possible to humiliate Sumner and to teach him a
lesson.  The interests of the country were not
allowed to stand in the way of this high purpose,
and so Motley went.  Or rather, he did not go.
Asked to resign in July, 1870, he disregarded that
request.  Grant hesitated; or perhaps Mr. Fish,
then Secretary of State, hesitated.  But in November
of the same year, Motley was recalled; an act
without precedent and happily never repeated.
No charges were made.  There were none to
make.  Motley's diplomatic record, his personal
character, were spotless.  The childish scandal
started at Vienna never had a rag of evidence to
support it; nor anything behind it but anonymous
personal animosity.  His departure from England
left no stain upon anybody except upon President
Grant, and upon such officers and Ministers of his
as stooped to be the instruments of his ill-will.

</p>

<p class="t3">
TWO MINISTERS AND TWO AMBASSADORS
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lowell may be compared with Mr. Motley
as an example of our American method of
appointing Ministers who not only are not&mdash;for they
could not be&mdash;trained diplomats, but whose
character is essentially undiplomatic.  Mr. Motley
was, however, so much more a man of the world
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
than Mr. Lowell that they cannot be bracketed.
There is a similarity but no identity.  Until
Lowell came to London he was a recluse.  Motley
had never been that.  Lowell had been a professor
in Harvard University.  Motley, though a student
and historian, was not what the English call
"Donnish," whereas Lowell had often the air of
lecturing the company, as if a company of pupils.
Delightful as his talk was, the touch of the
pedagogue was there.  Indeed, it may be doubted
whether life in a university, which is a world by
itself, is ever a good training for diplomacy.  An
Ambassador ought to be a man of the world&mdash;it
is perhaps the first and highest of his
qualifications&mdash;but not a man of a world.  A thorough
knowledge of the Greek aorist or of the proceedings
of Antigonus in Asia Minor is not needed in
the conduct of delicate negotiations; nor did Lowell
find his familiarity with Spanish literature of
much use at the Foreign Office, or in that larger
foreign office known as English Society.
</p>

<p>
Society was to Lowell in the beginning of his
English experiences a stumbling-block; and to the
end he only too often made a misstep.  He was
liked all the same.  The English are a people
who can make allowances, nor do they expect a
non-Englishman to be cast in an English mould.
They recognized his positive merits.  They did
not dwell on what they thought defects.  I
suppose I have before now told what I always thought
a characteristic saying of an English host, as
Lowell drove away from his door:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
</p>

<p>
"I need not tell you how much I like Lowell
and how delighted I am to have him here as often
as he will come.  But from the moment he enters
my house till he is gone I am in a panic."
</p>

<p>
The panic into which this genial host fell was
due to Lowell's fighting spirit; surely not the
spirit of a diplomatist.  To that and to a passion
for accuracy which he allowed to become pedantic
and aggressive.  He left behind him a path strewn
with victims; a renown for brilliancy; a just
repute for many amiable and delightful traits.
But the qualities essential to a Minister were not
among them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. E. J. Phelps, who came after him, was a
lawyer, and a lawyer may perhaps be expected to
be more combative than a professor; but it was
not so.  Mr. Phelps took Mr. Lowell's house in
Lowndes Square; a respectable dwelling in a very
good square, but by no means an ideal legation.
When Mr. Phelps became its tenant the atmosphere
changed; the climate was a softer climate.
The amelioration was due, in part, to Mrs. Phelps,
who was beloved.  Mrs. Lowell had been an
invalid.  Her husband used to say: "My wife has
no acquaintance and I have no invention"&mdash;as
an excuse for social shortcomings.  But
Mrs. Phelps knew a great many people and charmed
those whom she knew.
</p>

<p>
It is doubtful whether an abler man than
Mr. Phelps ever came from the United States to
London as Minister.  He was hailed at once as a
brother by his brethren of the Bar; and they put
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
him on a level with their best.  His simplicity
of character, his humour, his truthfulness, were
evident to everybody.  Intellectually he was
anybody's equal.  As Minister he had, like all his
predecessors, his trade to learn.  But he soon
learned what was essential; learned diplomacy as
if it were a new cause he had to master for a great
trial.  His mind was judicial.  He ought to have
been Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States.
</p>

<p>
With the promise of a nomination to that great
post in his pocket, he went home; but he returned.
The will of Mr. Pat Collins, of Boston&mdash;hating
Phelps because he would not, as Minister, be the
instrument of Irish ill-will to England&mdash;had proved
stronger than the will or the word of the President.
Mr. Cleveland's surrender, no doubt under strong
political pressure, deprived us of Mr. Phelps's
services as Chief Justice and he became a law
lecturer at Yale.  He was a jurist who would have
adorned either place.  He was also an orator who
leaped into fame by a single speech, at the
farewell dinner given him in London; although, indeed,
his speech at a dinner of welcome on his arrival was
scarcely less felicitous.  "A masterpiece of
oratory dignified, eloquent, and pathetic," said Lord
Rosebery, a judge of oratory if there be one.
</p>

<p>
We have sent to England so many different
kinds of Ministers and Ambassadors that they
must be praised&mdash;and, happily, most of them can
be praised&mdash;with discrimination, and also with
brevity, for I cannot go on for ever writing on a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
single topic.  I pass to Mr. Hay.  The mansion
Mr. Hay leased in Carlton House Terrace was,
like all those on the south side of that short street
looking on St. James's Park, adequate and
even imposing.  It was like unto the larger one
on the corner, formerly Lord Ardilaun's, now Lord
Ridley's.  When Mr. Blaine entered it one
evening at a concert he said to the friend who was
with him: "This is the first really palatial house
to which you have brought me."  Not a palace,
but palatial.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hay knew as well as any American then
living, or better, what a part social influences could
be made to play in diplomatic life.  He played
that part with distinction.  He was born for it.
He had cultivated his natural gifts in half a dozen
European capitals.  He had such a knowledge of
England and the English people that it has always
seemed a pity he did not write a book about them.
But he left a record as Ambassador which tells
the story.  He was a man who carried his point
without a collision.  He loved England and was
beloved.  When President McKinley sent for him
to come home and be Secretary of State Hay said:
"I am a soldier and must obey orders.  But all
my fun in life is over."
</p>

<p>
As it turned out it was not over.  A still greater
career opened before him, and he was the first
American Secretary of State to make an imaginative
use of his opportunities, and a great name in
Europe and Asia alike.  He was the first American
Secretary of State to take the lead in a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
world-embracing policy; to unite the European Powers
in support of it; to extract a binding pledge even
from Russia; to bring Japan, not very willingly, into
this charmed circle; and to lay the foundations
of American influence in China broad and deep.
We often talk of America as a world-power.  We
have a right to, and whatever be the more recent,
and perhaps in some cases rather doubtful,
extensions of our authority, we owe what is best and
most lasting in our position abroad to Hay.
</p>

<p>
None of all this could Hay foresee when he
quitted London for Washington.  What he knew
was that he was relinquishing a place for which
he had proved his fitness, and embarking upon
the unknown.  This sorrow at leaving England
was genuine, and the sorrow of his English friends,
and&mdash;if ever there be such a thing as a general
sorrow&mdash;of the English public, was not less.
</p>

<p>
The late Queen said of Hay: "He is the most
interesting of all the Ambassadors I have known."  If
the authority for this is wanted, it was said by
the Queen to Lord Pauncefote, then British
Ambassador to the United States; and Lord Pauncefote
repeated it to me, with leave to repeat it to
others, as I now do; by no means for the first
time.
</p>

<p>
To Mr. Hay succeeded Mr. Choate.  I hope it
will be taken as a compliment if I say Mr. Choate
was better liked the longer he stayed.  He had,
when he arrived, a frankness of speech which is
sometimes called American; and is, no doubt,
characteristic of certain individual Americans.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
There is in Mr. Henry James's <i>Bostonians</i> an
American banker settled in England to whom his
son, provoked by a remark of the father to a
noble lord who was his guest, observes:
</p>

<p>
"Well, father, you have lived here a long time,
and you have learned some of the things they say,
but you haven't learnt the things they don't
say."
</p>

<p>
It is inevitable.  In new social circumstances,
time is of the essence.  It is no reproach to
Mr. Choate that he found it so.  He had, and has,
an exuberant wit; one somewhat contemptuous of
conventions and established forms.  He poured
it out in floods.  He gave free scope to its caprices.
When it had become chastened by experience, the
English delighted in it; as we Americans have
long delighted in it.  But time was needed on
both sides.  The English and Mr. Choate had
to become accustomed to each other.  In the
end they did.  A beautiful harmony grew up, and
before Mr. Choate went home he was an accepted
figure in the society which at first had sometimes
a questioning spirit.  He, too, lived as an Ambassador
ought to live; and in Carlton House Terrace,
like Mr. Hay.  From the beginning the Foreign
Office had found in him, in Bismarck's phrase, a
man with whom it was possible to do business.
For he had a kind of preternatural rapidity in
mastering great affairs, and a marked skill in the
composition of public addresses.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br /><br />
TWO UNACCREDITED AMBASSADORS
</h3>

<p>
They were both from Boston.  In the days
when they first became known in England
and began their work of conciliation as between
England and the United States, Boston was still
Boston, and New York had only begun to be New
York.  The latter statement may be challenged,
but the very men who take most pride in the
New York of to-day ought to be the first to accept
it.  For Manhattan was not then the magnet, as
London has always been, which drew to itself
whatever was best from other parts of the land.
Boston was still the Athens of America.  There
were excellent names elsewhere and at least one
man of genius who owed neither birth nor culture
to Boston; but the capital of Massachusetts
was none the less the literary capital of the United
States.  Emerson, Holmes, Lowell, Longfellow,
Agassiz, R. H. Dana, Jr., were all living and all
in the fulness of their powers.  Theodore Parker,
the greatest force in the American pulpit, was
just dead.  Chief Justice Shaw had been for thirty
years the head of the judiciary of his own state
and a revered authority throughout the Union.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
Wendell Phillips had no rival as an orator.
Harvard was the first of American colleges.  The
ideas of New England, which were the ideas of
Boston, had spread and taken root, and new
commonwealths in the West were nourished on them;
nay, these ideas and these conceptions of law
and social order were the foundation stones on
which new States were built.  No theologian had
arisen to dim the fame&mdash;a great yet sombre
fame&mdash;of Jonathan Edwards.  Daniel Webster,
"disappointed, defeated, slept by the solemn waves of
the Atlantic," but you cannot think of Boston
or of Massachusetts without him; nor did the
disasters of his last years much lessen the homage
paid him at death or his immense influence on the
political thought of the whole country.
</p>

<p>
If the intellectual pre-eminence of Boston in
those days was somewhat grudgingly admitted
by New York, it was incontestable.  New York
presently redressed the balance, not so much by
her own creative efforts as by drawing much of
what there was best in Boston to the banks of the
Hudson.  I believe Mr. Howells's migration at a
later period was thought to be the decisive sign;
one of many.  Commercial influences prevailed
over the purer influences of literature.  The
publisher took command.  But I apprehend that
Mr. Howells did not forsake the Charles for the
Hudson without many regrets.  The atmosphere
was not the same.  Old Abernethy used to say:
"If you live in the best air in the world, leave it
and go to the second best."  Unconsciously,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
perhaps, Mr. Howells obeyed that medical
prescription.  He went to the second best.
</p>

<p>
Did he find a Tavern Club in New York?  Over
the <i>noctes coenæque</i> of that pleasant company in
Boston Mr. Howells used to preside, with a genial
charm all his own.  It was so long ago that I may
be forgiven if I remember in print one of those
evenings which owed so much to his presiding
genius.  He spoke and was the cause of speaking
in others.  He had the tact which drew from
others more than they supposed they had to give.
He gently compelled the most reluctant of guests
from their chairs.  There was a brief eulogy on
the victim.  It was Mr. Howells's art to paint a
portrait so vivid, albeit flattering, it needed no
name to be recognized.  "If," said he, "you
were in any doubt of his identity, you will
recognize him by the look of determined
unconsciousness on his face."
</p>

<p>
I reckon it among the highest of Mr. Howells's
many services that he has been at times an
interpreter between England and America, and in more
senses than one.  There is a sense in which every
American writer who reaches an English audience
is an interpreter, or, better still, an Ambassador,
the business of an Ambassador being to keep the
peace.  For when Lord Dufferin was complimented
on his diplomatic fame he answered: "Ah, that
is all a mistake.  So long as we succeed you never
hear of us.  It is when we have failed that the
world begins to know of our existence."
</p>

<p>
That, however, is a <i>malàpropos</i> anecdote, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
tells the other way; but in such papers as these
there must be anecdotes.  Mr. Howells was not
a silent Ambassador, and he would not have
been an Ambassador had he been silent.  His
books spoke for him.  The English thought, and
still think, that his writings had some qualities
which it does not suit the parent stock to consider
distinctively American.  They liked the reserve,
the simplicity, the continual though implicit
reference to English literature.  It was partly
because of the homage he paid to the great masters
that they presently came to accept him also as a
master.  They were quite aware that his homage
was sometimes reluctant.  When it went further
and, as in his unlucky criticism of the greatest of
English masters in fiction, became a caricature,
they resented it but they bore no malice.  How
can you bear malice against a writer with so much
sweetness of nature as Mr. Howells?
</p>

<p>
Besides, what he has written about England is
sympathetic; and is thought sympathetic by the
English.  If it be also at times critical, the English
accept the criticism as it is meant.  Nothing is
truer about them than their indifference to
criticism.  They regard Mr. Howells's essays as so
many studies, and these studies as interpretative.
What he has lately been writing of provincial
towns is almost a revelation to the Londoner, who
himself is sometimes called provincial, and does
not mind.
</p>

<p>
Another Bostonian, Mr. Henry James, took a
longer flight still; all the way from Boston to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
London and so to Paris and Italy, in all of which
he is equally at home.  It was, I think, Colonel
Higginson who, in his patriotic impatience of the
expatriated American, winged a shaft at
Mr. James, and at those who called him cosmopolitan.
"In order to be truly cosmopolitan," said this
eminent colonel, "a man ought to know something
of his own country."  To which Mr. James has
lately made the best possible reply by a book on
his own country which is an appreciation like no
other of recent days.  And I will say this, that if
Colonel Higginson supposes an American or a
Russian or a Japanese can win favour with the
English by trying to be English he is profoundly
mistaken.  The English like an American to be
an American.  If he is a writer, they like his
writings to be American.
</p>

<p>
Who are the American authors most popular in
England?  I will take the dead only.  They are
Hawthorne, Emerson, Lowell, Longfellow, Holmes,
Dana, and Walt Whitman; others, perhaps, but
if there are others they are all like these I have
named, American to the finger-tips, American in
thought, in language, in method; nay, if you like, in
accent.  That is why they are relished in England.
I do not include Poe.  He is better understood in
France than in England; his genius is perhaps
more Gallic than Saxon.  So much so that when
the American Ambassador delivered a discourse
at the celebration in London of Poe's centennial,
it was as if he had spoken on a topic remote from
the minds of this English people.  They read
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
him because he was American Ambassador, or
because he was Mr. Whitelaw Reid, and for his
graceful mastery of the topic and of the English
language.  But to them he seemed to be
announcing a discovery.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Henry James adopted his new manner&mdash;the
manner in which all his books since <i>The
Awkward Age</i> have been produced&mdash;his English
readers turned away from him, or many of them
did.  The change coincided, or nearly so, with
his change from pen and ink to dictation; a
perilous experiment.  But, whatever else may be
said of it, Mr. James has gradually won back his
English public.  To them the matter is more than
the manner, as in Mr. Meredith's case also.  The
American is now thought a more distinguished
writer than before.  I use the word distinguished
as he uses it, meaning that he has more distinction
as a writer and turns out more distinguished work.
They are no longer repelled by his colloquialisms,
by his Gallicisms, by his obscurities, by his
involutions of structure, or by the labyrinthine
length of his sentences.  Through all these, they
now perceive, pierces the true genius of the man.
Therefore is he another Ambassador, another of
those Americans who, from having become known
abroad, have added lustre to the fame of their
own country where, in European estimation, it
most needs lustre, namely, in the domain of
letters.
</p>

<p>
By the time the New Yorker of to-day has read
thus far, if he has read, it may have become clear
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
to him how great a part of all the renown in
literature we have abroad comes to us from Boston.
All the American writers best known here and
most read, Whitman excepted, are of Boston, or
of the State of which Boston is, or was, the final
expression.  If another exception were to be made
it would be Lincoln, whose greatest pieces of prose,
and most of all the Gettysburg address, are well
known to Englishmen who know anything of
America.  If what Dr. Jonson said in the preface
to his dictionary, "The chief glory of every
people arises from its authors," be true, then
what do we Americans not owe to Boston?
Supposing, that is, we care for the judgment of a
foreign nation, which Browning declared to be
like the judgment of posterity.
</p>

<p>
For some of these Bostonians London has a
personal affection.  Emerson is beloved.  Lowell
was an immense favourite; a favourite notwithstanding
his combativeness in a society which
prefers toleration to excursions on the warpath.
Holmes during his visits here was idolized, and as
the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table he is idolized,
and quoted day in and day out.  Of Longfellow's
Poems in the pre-copyright days more copies were
sold than of Tennyson, and when he was here the
English thought him almost one of themselves.
Dana's <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i> is the one story
of the sea which, among many rivals, seems likely
to be immortal in England, and is, meantime,
the one which in circulation year after year far
exceeds all others.  And Dana was one of those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
Americans on whom the English found an
English birthmark.
</p>

<p>
There was a time when Mr. James and Mr. Howells
used to be bracketed, as if they hunted in
couples; which was not a discriminating view,
though a popular view.  It expressed itself in the
jingle about "Howells and James Young Men,"
of which the music-hall was the proper home;
and there it related to a firm in Regent Street, now
extinct.  But it was sung by the daughters of a
house where Mr. James was a guest, and almost
in his hearing, to the horror of its mistress.  To
all popularity there are penalties.  But the
popularity of Mr. James is perennial.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><br />
SOME ACCOUNT OF A REVOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISM
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
Returning to New York in the early autumn
of 1866 and spending the winter in <i>The
Tribune</i> office, I was again sent abroad the
following year, this time under an agreement to
remain till 1870.  I was to go as the exponent of
a new theory of American journalism in Europe, a
theory based on the belief that the cable had
altered all the conditions of international news
gathering and that a new system had to be created.
I had been long enough in London and on the
Continent to be convinced that London must
become the distributing centre of European news for
America.  I talked it over with Mr. Young on my
return.  Mr. Young had a mind open to new
ideas and he was unusually quick in deciding.
But this suggestion struck him at first as a
proposal to impair the authority of the managing
editorship.  He thought, naturally, there ought
to be but one executive head, and that a European
manager, no matter how strictly subordinated to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
his chief in New York, would, at such a distance,
acquire too much independence.  The proposal,
moreover, was far-reaching and had no precedent;
not that the want of a precedent troubled
Mr. Young much.  He had spent much of his time
as managing editor of <i>The Tribune</i> in disregarding
precedents and laying down laws of his own.  But
this scheme, he presently saw, would never have
been thought of had not submarine telegraphy
taken a practicable shape, nor would such a
scheme have been of much practical use so long
as news went by mail.  Nor could it be tried till
a great many details had been thought out.
</p>

<p>
Under the old system, each <i>Tribune</i> correspondent
reported directly to New York.  Had
that system remained unaltered, the triumphs of
American journalism in Europe would have been
impossible.  That all the European representatives
of this paper should report to London instead
of New York might seem no very great matter,
but in truth it was vital.  When it had once been
decided to establish a <i>Tribune</i> office in London, a
revolution had taken place.  There was to be a
responsible agent in charge.  He was to organize
a new administration.  He was to appoint and
dismiss other agents all over the Continent.  He
was&mdash;subject, of course, to orders from New
York&mdash;to transmit news to New York.
</p>

<p>
He was to be the telephone between Europe and
the managing editor in New York.  But he was
to relieve the New York office of its supervision
over the European staff.  What St. Petersburg
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
and Vienna, Berlin and Paris, had to say to New
York was to be said through London.  There
would be an economy of time.  Orders could be
sent from London and results received much more
quickly than from New York.  In an emergency
as was presently to be shown, the difference was
enormous.  The notion of the centrality of London,
of its unity as a news bureau, was perfectly
simple.
</p>

<p>
But it took years for that one simple notion to
get itself completely accepted and acted upon.
I will give one illustration.  When the fatal days
of July, 1870, were upon us I thought I saw a great
opportunity.  <i>The Tribune</i> alone had an
organization in Europe competent for the work of
supplying war news.  But as I did not know how
much news New York wanted, I cabled a question
to the editor then temporarily in charge.  The
answer came back that I was to go to Berlin.
It would have been a fatal step.  I should have
come under German military rule, and cabling
from Berlin at that time and much later was a
slow and uncertain business.  Nor could the plans
I had in mind have been carried out from Berlin.
There would have been a censorship upon every
dispatch, and censorship means not merely
mutilation to suit a bureaucratic ideal, but delay.
Berlin, moreover, was remote, while London is on
the road to New York, and spite of the cable the
delay from that cause also would have been
injurious.  In short, I disobeyed the New York order.
I explained, of course, but I pointed out that an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
unfettered discretion was essential to success, and
I asked to be allowed a free hand or to be relieved.
I was given the free hand.
</p>

<p>
These methods have since become so familiar
that there is little need to explain them, but at
that time they were not merely novel but were
derided by journalists of great experience.
Mr. James Gordon Bennett was one of those who
scoffed at them, and presently was one of those
who followed them and made a large use of them,
greatly to his own profit and to that of the
considerable news organization he controlled.  But
at first he said nothing would induce him to set
up in London a rival office to New York.  Now,
every important journal in the United States has
offices in London, and subsidiary offices in Paris
and often in other European capitals.  But the
authority of New York or Chicago remains what
it was.
</p>

<p>
The idea once accepted, somebody had then to
be appointed to London.  Mr. Young asked me
to go.  I declined.  I liked leader-writing much
better than news-collecting.  I thought the power
of influencing opinion through the editorial columns
of <i>The Tribune</i> the most enviable of all powers.
The London scheme, moreover, was an experiment
and I did not think I had had enough experience
with news to justify my undertaking so large a
business.  But Mr. Young pressed it, saying it was my
scheme and I ought to put it in operation.  He
might, had he chosen, have issued an order and I
should have had no choice but to obey or resign;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
but that was not his way.  He trusted to
persuasion; he treated his subordinates as, for some
purposes, his equals, and he did not care for
unwilling service.  He was a past master in the art
of stating a case and in the use of personal influence.
In the end he convinced me not only that I ought
to go, but that I wanted to go, and I gave in, still
with misgivings but not without a certain
enthusiasm at the prospect of doing a new thing
in journalism.  It was like Young to say, as he
did at parting: "Remember, I don't care about
methods.  You will use your own methods.
What I want is results."
</p>

<p>
The incredulity with which <i>The Tribune</i> experiment
was first received gave way slowly, but it
gave way.  I suppose it was the news service of
<i>The Tribune</i> in the Franco-German War in 1870
which finally convinced the most sceptical.  So I
will pass to that, stopping only to explain one
other matter.
</p>

<p>
It was in 1870 also that the first international
newspaper alliance was formed.  The papers which
formed it were <i>The Tribune</i> of New York and
<i>The Daily News</i> of London.  I saw at the beginning
that it was desirable to be in a position to
know what news would go to New York through
Reuter and The Associated Press.  That
knowledge was only to be had inside of a London
newspaper office, and it was with that view chiefly
that I first made a proposal to <i>The Daily News</i>.
I suppose I chose that paper because I knew its
editor and manager.  I did not think it likely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
that <i>The Daily News</i> service from the battlefields
would, at first, add much to our own; nor did it.
But I went to Mr.&mdash;afterward Sir John&mdash;Robinson
with an offer to exchange news, whether
by telegraph or mail, on equal terms; we to give
them everything we had and they to do the like
by us.  The offer was very coldly received.
Mr. Robinson could see no advantage to his paper from
such an agreement.  I told him what we were
doing and intending to do.  Still he was incredulous
and he finally said No.  I told him I did not
mean that either paper should narrow its operations
at the seat of war in expectation of help from
the other, nor that either should credit the other
with its news.  It was to be a war partnership
and each would put all its forces in the field.  But
he would not have it.
</p>

<p>
It was Mr. Frank Hill, then editor of <i>The Daily
News</i>, who came to the rescue.  The news department
was none of his but he had an all-embracing
intelligence, and when he heard what the offer was
he pressed it upon his colleague and finally secured
its acceptance.  The credit for whatever benefit
inured to <i>The Daily News</i> from this partnership
was therefore due originally to Mr. Frank Hill
and not to Mr. Robinson.
</p>

<p>
It remains true that Mr. Robinson was a very
distinguished journalist and that his work at a
later period of the war was of a high order.  If
he had done nothing but secure the services of
Mr. Archibald Forbes he would have earned a
lasting renown as manager.  But before Forbes's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
work had begun to tell, <i>The Daily News</i>, receiving
and publishing <i>The Tribune</i> dispatches as its
own&mdash;as it had an absolute right to do under our
agreement&mdash;had won a great reputation for its war
news.  Sir John Robinson is dead but I published
a statement on this subject while he was living,
which was brought to his attention.  I said then,
as I say now, that <i>The Daily News</i> owed to <i>The
Tribune</i> almost the whole of the war news by
which its reputation was at first acquired.  This
period lasted down to the surrender of Metz;
perhaps later.  My statement was never disputed.
It may still be found in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, where
the facts are set forth much more fully than here,
and it was this article in <i>Harper's</i> which Sir John
Robinson read.  We had ceased to be on good
terms.  I forget why.  He grumbled a little at
the publication of the story, though without
reason, but he attempted no denial and no denial
was possible.
</p>

<p>
The matter was much discussed at the time in
the American Press and there were many criticisms,
based on an absolute ignorance of the real
arrangement between the two papers.  Further confusion
grew out of the fact that one of <i>The Tribune's</i>
war correspondents had a contract with <i>The Pall
Mall Gazette</i>, then owned by Mr. George Smith
and edited by Mr. Frederick Greenwood, one of
the great journalists of his time.  This contract
left him free to deal with us but not with any
London paper.  It followed, therefore, that some
of <i>The Tribune</i> dispatches appeared in <i>The Daily
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
News</i> and some in <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>.  Our
New York friends could not understand this
tri-partite agreement; but then it was not necessary
they should; and their comments were much
more amusing than they would have been if they
had known the truth.  The mind moves with
great freedom when unhampered by facts.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
"American methods," said certain English
journalists, seeking to account for <i>The Tribune's</i>
successes in the Franco-German War.  The phrase,
whether meant as eulogy or criticism, was, at
any rate, explanatory, for we had had four years
of Civil War experience, from 1861 to 1865, while
the English, unless we reckon the Indian Mutiny,
had to go back to the Crimean War in 1854 for
precedents in war correspondence.  Moreover,
the one great triumph of English journalism in
the Crimea was not a triumph of method.  It
was a triumph due to the genius and courage of
one man, Dr. Russell, who exposed through <i>The
Times</i> the murderous mistakes of army organization
and army administration, and so forced the
War Office and the Horse Guards to set their
houses in order.  It was a great public service;
perhaps the greatest which any journalist in the
field ever performed.  But it was not exactly
journalism.  It had little or nothing to do with
that speed and accuracy in the collection and
transmission of news which, after all, must be the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
chief business of a correspondent.  It has never
been imitated.  It never will be till another
Russell appears to rescue another British army in
another Crimea.  That great exploit was not
primarily journalistic but personal.
</p>

<p>
I do not suppose it occurred to any of the many
able newspaper managers in London that in
dealing with a European war they would find a rival
in an American journal.  They knew there was
an Atlantic cable but probably thought, if they
thought about it at all, that the cable tolls would
be prohibitive, for, as we shall see in a moment,
they had not yet grasped the idea that the telegraph
is only a quicker post.  Putting the question
of cost aside, it does not matter how a piece of
news or a dispatch or a letter is transmitted;
whether by rail or by steamship or by wire.  What
matters is that it should get there.  To-day this
is a truism.  Forty years ago it was a paradox;
in Europe if not in America.  There had been
great achievements in the transmission of news
long before the telegraph was invented.  It may
be doubted whether they were not, some of them,
greater than those due to the telegraph.  But so
far as the use of the telegraph is concerned we are
dealing with the beginnings.  The year 1870 is a
year of transition if not of revolution.  I think we
are entitled to remember with satisfaction that in
telegraphic news enterprise, even in Europe, it was
an American journal which led the way, and that
<i>The Tribune</i> was that journal.
</p>

<p>
In forming their war plans the managers of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
English journals, as I was saying, left American
journals out of account.  Perhaps they knew, in a
dim kind of way, that <i>The Tribune</i> had an office
in London.  But the office had been there for
three years and no other American journal had
yet followed <i>The Tribune's</i> example.  Important
dispatches had been sent from this London office
to the New York office by cable, but the London
managers, if aware of the existence of the cable
and of <i>The Tribune</i> office in London, had not
co-ordinated these two pieces of knowledge.  The
area of all possible competition in war was news
confined, in their view, to Fleet Street and
Printing House Square.
</p>

<p>
They sat content, true Britons as they were, in
their belief in their own supremacy; a supremacy
often challenged, never overthrown.  <i>The Times</i>
was still <i>The Times</i>.  <i>The Morning Post</i> was still
a threepenny paper.  <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> was
still the organ of the small shopkeeper.  <i>The
Daily News</i> was the mouthpiece of Nonconformist
Liberalism, with no great pretensions to any other
sort of authority.  The evening journalism was
not supposed to be eager for news, except news of
that peculiar description which offers its readers
an afternoon sensation and is unaccountably
omitted from the next morning's papers.  The
news journalism was yet to be born.  <i>The Daily
Mail</i> had never been heard of.  Lord Northcliffe,
the man who has done more than all others of his
time toward the creation of a new journalism in
England, and who is almost more a statesman
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
than a journalist, was then just two years
old.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the outbreak of war was unexpected.
Lord Granville was then Foreign Secretary and
of an unshaken optimism.  Lord Hammond, Permanent
Under Secretary of the Foreign Office, had
announced a fortnight before that never since he
had held a place in that office had the sky been
so free from clouds.  M. Émile Ollivier has lately
retold with skill in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>
how the war was brought on, but there is nothing
in his elaborate special pleading to show that any
reasonable man ought to have expected the French
Emperor, or even M. Ollivier himself, to follow
the unreasonable, mad, arrogant policy they did
follow.  Nor can Downing Street or Fleet Street
or Printing House Square be blamed for not being
aware that the conduct of affairs in France was in
the control of men who would play into Bismarck's
hands.  For, let M. Ollivier say what he will,
Bismarck's opportunity would not have come had
not France, after Prussia had withdrawn Prince
Leopold's candidature for the throne of Spain,
demanded a guarantee that it should never be
renewed or never be supported by Prussia.  Never
had events moved so quickly.  Prince Leopold
was first heard of July 4th, 1870.  On the 12th he
renounced his claim.  On the 13th Benedetti laid
before the King of Prussia at Ems the demand of
France for guarantees.  On the 14th Earl Granville
woke from his deep dream of peace and strove
to bring France and Prussia to terms.  On the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
15th the Emperor declared war; the Chamber
approving by an overwhelming majority.
</p>

<p>
There are in journalism two ways of dealing
with a war crisis of this kind.  One way is to
send into the field everybody you can lay hands
on to cover, <i>tant bien que mal</i>, as many points as
possible, and so take your chance of what may
turn up.  The other is to choose the best two men
available and send one to the headquarters of
each army.  I preferred the latter, perhaps because
there was a difficulty in finding good men, and
there were but two from whom I expected much
good.  These were Mr. Holt White, an Englishman,
and M. Méjanel, a Frenchman.  Mr. White
was ordered to join the Prussians and M. Méjanel
to accompany his own countrymen.  The same
instructions were given to both; very simple but I
believe at that time quite novel in England.  Each
was to find his way to the front, or wherever a
battle was most likely to be fought.  They were
to telegraph to London as fully as possible all
accounts of preliminary engagements.  If they
had the good luck to witness an important battle
they were not to telegraph, but, unless for some
very peremptory reason, to start at once for
London, writing their accounts on the way or on
arrival.  If they could telegraph a summary first,
so much the better; but there must be no delay.
The essential thing was to arrive in London at the
earliest moment.  They were to provide beforehand
for a substitute, or more than one, who would
take up their work during their absence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
</p>

<p>
These instructions were based on the improbability
that any single correspondent could anticipate
any very important news which Governments,
the news agencies, and the Rothschilds would all
three endeavour to send first.  I reverse the order
in which a Minister once said to me news of war or
of high politics usually arrived.  Such news, he
said, comes to the Rothschilds first, next to the
Press, and to the Government last of all.  Besides,
the mere fact never contents the public.  It wants
the full story.  There was never much chance of
sending the full story by wire from the battlefield
or from any town hard by; nor, indeed, from any
capital; even from a neutral capital.  Only when
once in London was a correspondent master of
the situation.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Holt White carried out his instructions with
an energy, a courage, an intelligence to which no
tribute can be too high.  In the first instance he
witnessed the battle&mdash;not an important one
except that it was the first&mdash;of Spicheren, and
wired a column or so to London.  It was I believe,
the first battle story of any length ever sent
by wire from the Continent to London.  English
journalism, as I said above, had not yet regarded
the telegraph as anything but a means of transmitting
results.  The full account was to come by
mail.  I had told Mr. Robinson I meant to use
the telegraph in this new way, but he was not
ready to believe it could be done.  So when I
carried Mr. White's account to <i>The Daily News</i>
office, after cabling a rewritten copy to New York,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
I took with me the original telegraph forms as
well as the second copy.  The dispatch as
telegraphed by Mr. White was slightly condensed,
had been carelessly handled, and was not in good
shape for the printers.  I handed my copy to
Mr. Robinson.  He looked at it with undisguised
suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"It is your handwriting," he said.
</p>

<p>
I admitted that.
</p>

<p>
"And the battle was fought only yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"It could not have come by post."
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Well, how then?"
</p>

<p>
"By wire."
</p>

<p>
"A dispatch of that length!  It is unheard of."
</p>

<p>
But I thought this had gone far enough and
showed him the telegraph forms.  Still he said:
</p>

<p>
"Do you expect me to print this to-morrow in
<i>The Daily News</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Print it or not as you choose.  It will certainly
appear in <i>The Tribune</i>.  I have done as I agreed in
bringing you the dispatch.  You, of course, will
do as you think best about publishing it."
</p>

<p>
I repeat this because it indicates better than
I could otherwise the journalistic state of mind
at that time in respect of Continental telegrams.
Mr. Robinson was at the head of his profession,
yet this was his reception of this piece of news.
In the end Mr. Frank Hill, the editor, was called
into consultation.  He had no hesitation and, as
before, finally brought his colleague to reason.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
The telegram duly appeared next morning in
<i>The Daily News</i>, heralded by a leading article in
which the telegram was rewritten, its importance
pointed out, the celerity of its dispatch and arrival
dwelt on, and so the readers of <i>The Daily News</i>
had every opportunity to admire the enterprise
of that journal.
</p>

<p>
This was very far from being Mr. Holt White's
most brilliant exploit, but it was his first.  He
had not the luck to see the battle of Worth, the
earliest of the grave disasters of the French.  No
journalist had.  That great engagement and the
defeat of Marshal MacMahon were foreseen by
nobody, the Germans themselves excepted, and
there exists no account of the battle in the
newspapers of the day, save such as came by hearsay;
or, much later, the official reports.  But when
the bare facts were known they were thought
prophetic, and the military critics of Pall Mall
and Whitehall said gravely: "This is the
beginning of the end."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
  HOLT WHITE'S STORY OF SEDAN AND HOW IT<br />
  REACHED THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE<br />
</h3>

<p>
I pass over the interval between Worth and
Sedan, crowded as it was with events, stopping
only to remark that <i>The Tribune</i> was indebted to
an American writer on <i>The Daily News</i> for its
account of Gravelotte, but not to <i>The Daily News</i>
except for the opportunity of buying that account,
at a high price.  There was an entangling alliance
which forbade <i>The Daily News</i> to hand it over to
<i>The Tribune</i>, but did not prevent the correspondent
of that paper from selling it.  I am not sure
whether the name of the writer is known but in
the circumstances it is not for me to disclose it.
The narrative was, of course, cabled to <i>The
Tribune</i> at once.  Gravelotte was fought on the 18th
of August.  The account of the battle reached
New York, I think, on the 21st.  It was, at any
rate, the first, and for some time the only narrative
published.  The defeated French called it the
battle of Rézonville, and under that name was
this description first printed.  From a military
point of view the account had no great value,
but it was picturesquely written and in those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
difficult days anything from the field was eagerly
read.
</p>

<p>
Greater days were at hand.  The battle of
Sedan was fought on Thursday, September 1st,
1870, followed by the surrender of the town, the
army, and the Emperor Napoleon on the day
following.  The news of the catastrophe was not
known in London till Saturday morning at ten
o'clock, and then only in the briefest form; the
mere fact and not much more; through the general
Press agency; I suppose Reuter's.  Mr. Robinson
wired me and I went to <i>The Daily News</i> office.
But the bare news was of no great use for my
purposes.  I went back to <i>The Tribune</i> office in
Pall Mall wondering what I was to do, and still
more what <i>The Tribune</i> correspondent in the
field were doing.  I had not long to wait.  A
dispatch arrived from Mr. Holt White saying he
should be in London that afternoon, and at five
o'clock he walked into the office.
</p>

<p>
Seldom have I been so glad to see any man's
face as I was to see his, but there was hardly so
much as a greeting between us.  I asked first:
</p>

<p>
"Is your dispatch ready?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a word of it written."
</p>

<p>
"Will you sit down at once and begin?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot.  I am dead tired, and have had no
food since daybreak.  I must eat and sleep before
I can write."
</p>

<p>
He looked it; a mere wreck of a correspondent,
haggard, ragged, dirty, incapable of the effort
which nevertheless had to be made.  It was no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
time to consider anybody's feelings.  A continent
was waiting for the news locked up in that one
man's brain, and somehow or other the lock must
be forced, the news told, and the waiting continent
supplied with what it wanted.  Incidentally, it
was such an opportunity for <i>The Tribune</i> as
seldom had come to any newspaper.  It was
necessary to use a little authority.  I said to
Mr. Holt White:
</p>

<p>
"You shall have something to eat, but sleep
you cannot till you have done your dispatch.
That must be in New York to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
So we went over to the Pall Mall Restaurant,
which was then in the building now replaced by
the Oceanic House, the headquarters of the
International Marine Navigation Company; if that
be its name.  Food and drink refreshed him.
We were back in <i>The Tribune</i> office not long after
six and work began.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Holt White wrote one of the worst hands
ever seen, so I said to him I would copy as he
wrote and my copy would go to the cable
operators.  Bad or good, mine was a hand they were
familiar with.  We sat opposite each other at the
same table, and I copied sheet by sheet till there
was enough to give the cable a start, then took it
to the Anglo-American cable office in Telegraph
Street.  I went myself for two reasons: first to
make sure it was delivered, and second to make
sure it went without interruption.  The latter,
indeed, was a point of which it was impossible,
under the Weaver régime, to make sure.  But I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
could at least hand in the message over the counter.
Many a message have I trusted myself and
nobody else with, and many a letter have I posted
with my own hands; everything, in fact, of
importance ever since I had anything to do with
journalism.  It is often inconvenient but I have
found it a good rule.
</p>

<p>
I dwell on these details.  Few things in American
journalism, the Civil War excepted, have made
more stir than this exploit of Mr. Holt White.
But the full credit which belongs to him he has
never had.  Consider what he had done.  He had
been all through the battle; he had been in the
saddle all day from four o'clock in the morning
till nightfall.  The battle over, he started for
London.  He rode with his life in his hand.  He
had to pass the lines of three armies, the Prussians
who refused him a permit, the French outposts to
the north of Sedan, and the Belgians, who made a
pretence of guarding their frontier and the neutrality
of Belgian territory.  He could not explain
how he managed it.  When he reached Brussels
he thought it might be possible to write there and
to wire his account from Brussels to London.
But at the chief telegraph office in Brussels the
official in charge told him flatly he would accept
no dispatch relating to the war.  The issue of the
battle was unknown in Brussels.  Anything handed
in for transmission to London or elsewhere would
be submitted first of all to the censor; and in
Brussels, as elsewhere, the censorship is a
heart-rending business; delay inevitable; and there was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
no time for delay.  It was, as I explained in an
earlier chapter, one reason why all correspondents
were directed to come straight to London where
the censorship did not exist.  Mr. Holt White was
soon satisfied that it was useless to try to telegraph
from Brussels, and he came on by train to Calais,
missed the Calais boat, caught a later one, which
did not connect with the Dover-London service,
and, once at Dover, chartered a special train to
London and so at last arrived.
</p>

<p>
I asked him if any other correspondent had
come with him.  He thought not; at any rate, no
one whom he knew as correspondent and, of course,
no one came by the special train.  Still, there was
no certainty.  It was already two days since the
sun had gone down on the beaten French in sedan.
There was nothing to do except to hurry on the
dispatch to New York.
</p>

<p>
With indomitable courage White wrote on.
After a time I asked him if he would rest a
little before finishing.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "if I stop I shall go to sleep,
and if I go to sleep I shall not wake."
</p>

<p>
The man's pluck was a splendid thing to see.
His answer was like the answer of an Atlantic
captain who, in the old days when there was no
telephone and designers had not learned how to
make the captain's cabin the nerve centre of the
ship, had been for three days and nights on the
bridge.  I asked him how he lived through it.
He said it was rather trying to the knees.
</p>

<p>
"But did you never sit down?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if I had sat down I should have gone to
sleep."
</p>

<p>
There are heroisms of that kind in the routine
of life, professional and other, and even in the
profession of journalism of which the newspaper
reader in the morning over his coffee and rolls
never thinks.  But they are real and without them,
and without the loyalty and devotion of such men,
there might sometimes be nothing for the man
with his coffee and rolls to read.
</p>

<p>
White sat at his table till midnight and later.
It was nearer two o'clock than one before the
last of his message was filed in Telegraph Street.
Whether by Mr. Weaver's intervention or not I
cannot say, but there was a delay on the wires.
The delay, I was afterwards told, was on the
Newfoundland land lines to New York.  It may
be so.  It was a message six columns long and
not all of it appeared in <i>The Tribune</i> that next
Sunday morning though all of it had been filed
in ample time; two o'clock in the morning in
London being only nine o'clock of the evening
before in New York.
</p>

<p>
No matter.  It was a clear, coherent, vivid
battle story, and it was the only one.  No morning
paper in London had any account of the battle
till the Tuesday following; and all New York
accounts, <i>The Tribune</i> excepted, were from the
London Press or Press agencies.  It is not worth
while to recall the comments of <i>The Tribune's</i>
rivals.  They were angry, naturally enough, and
they resorted to conjectures which might as well
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
have been left unexpressed.  It is enough to
explain further that Mr. Holt White's narrative
did not appear in <i>The Daily News</i> because he had
an agreement with <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>.  Part
of this account, therefore, was printed in an
abridged form in <i>The Pall Mall</i> of Monday, for
which it was written separately.  <i>The Pall Mall</i>
is an evening paper, and when that was cabled to
New York and found to be obviously from the
same source as <i>The Tribune's</i> the guesses grew
wild.  But the plain truth is now told, and is
simple enough.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Holt White was a journalist but not at that
time a journalist of any exceptional reputation
or position.  This, I think, was the first very
considerable thing he had done.  I am sorry to
have to add that it was also the last.  He was a
man to whom, after such an achievement as this,
a long repose became necessary.  He rejoined the
Prussian headquarters, spent the winter at Versailles,
and during all those months did practically
nothing.  Of his great gifts and capacities he made
no further use, even down to the end of his life,
and the end came early.  But he is entitled to be
remembered as a man who at one supreme moment
accomplished one of the most brilliant exploits in
the history of journalism.  Let us judge him by
his best, and, so judged, his name must take its
place with those of Russell, McGahan, Forbes,
Steevens, and others of that rank if there are any
others.
</p>

<p>
One more remark, to remind you how alien from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
the mind of the British journalist at that time was
the free use of the telegraph, which in America
had become a thing of every day.  When White sat
down to write he said to me: "I suppose I am to
condense as much as possible?"
</p>

<p>
"No, write fully."
</p>

<p>
"But it is going by cable."
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"It will be some columns long."
</p>

<p>
"The longer the better."
</p>

<p>
He thought a little, then said:
</p>

<p>
"I still don't quite understand."
</p>

<p>
"Then please put the cable out of your mind,
and write exactly as if you were writing for a
London paper and the printer's devil waiting."  And
he did.

CHAPTER XXV
<br /><br />
GREAT EXAMPLES OF WAR CORRESPONDENCE
</h3>

<p>
But Sedan from the Prussian point of view
was one thing; from the French it might be,
and must be, quite another.  M. Méjanel, had
things gone otherwise, might have been expected to
give us the French version, but since he was with
the French headquarters in Sedan he was presumably
a prisoner of war, and nothing was to be
hoped for from him.  Mr. Holt White, fresh from
the field, thought there was little or no chance.
No one except Mr. White had got through from
either army.  The English papers of Monday
morning were a blank except for a few rather
ragged telegrams.  Mr. Robinson at <i>The Daily
News</i>, had nothing.  There was a lull.  I am
speaking of war news proper, for there was, of
course, the one great event of Saturday in Paris,
and there was no certainty whence the next flash
of light, or lightning, would come.  Sedan had
been fought on Thursday, and it was now Monday
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
While I sat in <i>The Tribune</i> office in Pall Mall
brooding on these difficulties and almost
despairing of further good fortune the door opened,
and in walked Méjanel.  He had not telegraphed.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
He had a Gallic indifference to time and to the
technique of journalism.  He had just come as
soon as he could.  An angel from heaven would
have been less welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Were you in Sedan during the battle?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and outside with the army."
</p>

<p>
"Were you taken prisoner?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"You were released?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I forget whether I was released or
whether I escaped."
</p>

<p>
To escape meant that he had taken his chance
of being shot by a Prussian sentry, and also of
being rearrested and tried by court martial should
he fall again into Prussian hands.  Released,
therefore, seemed the better word of the two.
</p>

<p>
"Have you written your account?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I had no means of writing while a
prisoner, and I have since been doing my best
to get to London."
</p>

<p>
As in White's case, there was time enough.
Méjanel had an English side to him&mdash;his mother
was English&mdash;and that half of him was
imperturbable.  Neither the danger he had passed nor
the task that lay before him, all inexperienced as
he was, shook his nerves.  He was quite ready to
sit down and write at once.  As in White's case,
I copied sheet by sheet.  Méjanel's English was
here and there at fault but was, on the whole,
good.  What was more important, his memory
was precise; he knew how to tell his story clearly,
and he gave us a picture of the battle-horrors
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P245"></a>245}</span>
from within the beleaguered town or from within
the French defence, which he made the reader
see as he himself had seen them.  He wrote on
till he had filled four columns, modestly
wondering as he wrote whether he was not too diffuse;
wondering that it should be thought worth
cabling; wondering whether his English was good
enough; and wondering whether the military part
of it was not all nonsense.  Reassured on all these
points, he wrote fluently and joyfully, at midnight
laying down his pen with the remark: "<i>Enfin,
j'ai vidé mon sac</i>."
</p>

<p>
M. Méjanel's dispatch appeared in <i>The Tribune</i>
complete on Tuesday morning.  Neither
Mr. Weaver nor the Newfoundland lines were out of
order this time.  <i>The Tribune</i>, had, therefore,
within less than three days of the first coming of
the news of the battle of Sedan, given to the
American public complete accounts&mdash;ten columns
altogether&mdash;of the battle from the Prussian
side and from the French side; a unique
performance.
</p>

<p>
Nor was this all.  The revolution in Paris and
the declaration of the Republic, September 4th,
were dealt with not less fully, and of course by
cable.  During four days the number of words
cabled was a little over sixteen thousand, at a
cost of as many dollars.  If we never rose again
to quite those heights it was because never again
was there such a quick sequence of great events.
But for a long time the daily average was high,
and not long after this <i>The Daily News</i> service
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P246"></a>246}</span>
became efficient, and, as I have said before, <i>The
Tribune</i> in the end profited by it.
</p>

<p>
Before, however, the full advantage of that
accrued came the surrender of Metz, October 27th,
and the remarkable narrative, including a visit
to Metz, published simultaneously by <i>The Daily
News</i> and <i>The Tribune</i>.  It was supposed in
London that Mr. Archibald Forbes was the author
of this narrative, and it was reckoned among his
best performances.  <i>The Daily News</i> never thought
it worth while to state the truth; nor was it bound
to make any statement.  The real author was
Mr. Gustav Müller, a correspondent in the employment
of <i>The Tribune</i>.  As in the other cases I have
described, Mr. Gustav Müller came to London and
wrote his account in <i>The Tribune</i> office.  It was
cabled forthwith to New York, and a copy handed
to <i>The Daily News</i>.  It was the first to be published
in London, and the first to be published in New
York.  So far as London is concerned, it is enough
to say that <i>The Times</i> on the following morning
copied it from <i>The Daily News</i>, crediting it to
<i>The Daily News</i>, with a deserved compliment, and
saying:
</p>

<p>
"We congratulate our contemporary on the
energy and enterprise of its correspondent."
</p>

<p>
Still, Mr. Robinson did not think it needful to
explain that it was in fact a <i>Tribune</i> dispatch, and
that it was a <i>Tribune</i> correspondent who had
wrung from <i>The Times</i> this testimony.
</p>

<p>
The tale has a tragic end.  For a long time I
thought it a tragedy of death.  I sent Mr. Gustav
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P247"></a>247}</span>
Müller back to the field at once, with a large sum
of money.  I never heard from him again.
Inquiries in every possible quarter brought no
tidings of him.  It seemed plain that he had fallen
in battle or had been murdered and robbed by
some of the bands that hang on the outskirts of
every army.  Some years after I told the whole
story in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, leaving the mystery
unexplained otherwise than by conjecture.  When,
lo! it appeared that Mr. Gustav Müller had not
fallen by a French bullet or a brigand's knife,
but was alive in New York and ready to submit
to an interview.  If he were truly reported, he
seemed to think his conduct in no need of defence.
He had changed his mind, and instead of returning
to the field had gone home.  Why he never wrote
to me or communicated in any way with <i>The
Tribune</i> he omitted to say.
</p>

<p>
As I have stripped one leaf from Mr. Forbes's
laurels, I will add that two of the most brilliant
news exploits in all the history of war journalism
are to be credited to him.  One was his night ride
of 110 miles alone through a hostile country, after
the British victory of Ulundi, July 4th, 1879.
Lord Chelmsford, commanding the British forces,
had refused Forbes leave to start and given orders
for his arrest.  He risked the British bullets and
the Zulu assegais, and got through.  The other
was at the Shipka Pass, in August, 1877.  It was
the crisis of the Russo-Turkish War.  General
Gourko was holding the Pass.  Suleiman Pacha
day after day was flinging his whole force against
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
the Russian entrenchments.  The world was
waiting.  No news came.  The Russians and Turks
were not people who concerned themselves much
about public opinion.  Forbes was at Bucharest.
Tired of expecting messages from the scene, he
rode to the Pass, made his way through the Turks
and into the Russian lines, stayed in the trenches
till he had satisfied himself&mdash;and he was a
competent judge&mdash;that Suleiman's effort was spent
and that Gourko could hold his own, and then
made his way out again, hoping to reach Bucharest
in time for a dispatch that night to<i> The Daily
News</i>.  At or near Tirnova he was stopped by the
Russians and taken before the Czar.
</p>

<p>
The Czar, like the rest of the world, was without
news.  He had sent one aide-de-camp after another
to the Pass; not one had returned.  Forbes used
to say that the Czar treated him very well.  He
asked if it was true that Forbes had been with
General Gourko, and, when told it was, desired
that the exact situation should be explained to
him.  Forbes set it forth with that military
clearness and precision which made his work in the
field invaluable.  The Czar asked him if he could
draw a plan.  He drew it.  All sorts of questions
were put to him.  He answered all.  He was asked
for his opinion.
</p>

<p>
"I told His Imperial Majesty that I had been
a soldier, that I had had much experience of
battles as a correspondent, and that I had no
doubt General Gourko would hold the Pass."
</p>

<p>
The interview lasted an hour or more.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
</p>

<p>
"At the end I besought His Majesty's permission
to continue my journey, saying I thought
nothing was known in Europe, and that it was
for the interest of Russia that the facts which I
had had the honour to lay before His
Imperial Majesty should be made public.  The
Czar thanked me for the information I had
given, declared himself convinced it was true
and my judgment well founded, and dismissed me."
</p>

<p>
So Forbes rode on, arriving at Bucharest, the
first point from which it was possible to
telegraph, at eight o'clock in the evening.  It was
Forbes himself who told me the story:
</p>

<p>
"I had been in the saddle or in the trenches and
under fire for three days and nights, without sleep
and with little food.  When I walked into the
hotel at Bucharest I was a beaten man.  I felt
as if I could not keep awake or sit in my chair,
much less write.  Yet it was an opportunity which
does not come twice in a man's life.  I had, and
nobody else had, the news for which all Europe
was hungering; the most momentous news since
Sedan; but not one word written, and not an
ounce of strength left."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what did you do?"
</p>

<p>
The answer was curious indeed.
</p>

<p>
"I called the waiter and told him to bring me
a pint of champagne, unopened.  I uncorked it,
put the neck of the bottle into my mouth before
the gas had time to escape, and drank the whole
of the wine.  Then I sat up and wrote the four
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
columns which appeared next morning in <i>The
Daily News</i>."
</p>

<p>
I remember that narrative well.  There was not
in it from beginning to end a trace of fatigue or
confusion.  It was a bulletin of war, written with
masterly ease, with the most admirable freshness
and force.  Nothing better of the kind was ever
done.  It rang from one end of Europe to the
other, and across the Atlantic.  The Hour and
the Man in this case had come together, and if
Forbes had done nothing else this would entitle
him to the immortality which is his.
</p>

<p>
All the same, the pint of champagne was a
hazardous experiment.  Forbes knew it but, as
he said, it was that or nothing.  The next man
who tries it ought to be very sure that he has
both the intellectual elasticity Forbes had, and
his physique.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><br />
A PARENTHESIS
</h3>

<p>
To what I have said of journalism I need not
add much.  I remained in London as the
representative of <i>The New York Tribune</i>, and in
charge of its European affairs from 1867 to 1895;
returning then to New York and Washington for
<i>The Times</i>, till 1905.
</p>

<p>
When <i>The Tribune</i> began publishing a Sunday
edition, one other innovation upon the established
practice followed.  I sent each week, by cable, a
column containing a summary view of what seemed
most important during the week.  It was not a
summary of news and it was not a leading article
but a compromise between the two.  It was, at
any rate, the first of its kind, and I was allowed
to put it in such shape as I thought best, since
then, the American demand for what are called
"Sunday cables" has grown, the despatches to all
the great journals of the United States have
increased in number, in length, in variety, and in
daring.  All I claim for mine is that it was the
first.  I do not know whether any work in
journalism has in it the elements of permanency.
Probably not.  Journalism is an expression of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>
governing forces of the day, and day by day
changes as the forces change and the days change.
But should a history of international journalism
be written, the historian will perhaps remember
that as agent of <i>The Tribune</i> I set up in London
that European news-bureau which all other great
American journals after some years copied; that I
was in charge of it during the Franco-German
War; and that the success of <i>The Tribune</i> during
that war was due to the system already described,
which I had established three years before.
</p>

<p>
The years that follow are full of miscellaneous
interests.  The Memories, some of which are
reprinted in this volume, are not primarily historical,
though I hope they are accurate.  They are
impressions.  They cannot be presented as a sequence,
and as each chapter, or group of chapters, deals
with a separate subject, I republish most of them
in the order in which they were written and
printed, or otherwise as may seem convenient.
I pass now to an incident of the Irish "War," and
then to a diplomatic experiment in the history of
those long contentious relations between Canada
and the United States which have so often
imperilled the friendship between England and the
United States.

CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><br />
  "CIVIL WAR?"&mdash;INCIDENTS IN THE 'EIGHTIES&mdash;SIR<br />
  GEORGE TREVELYAN&mdash;LORD BARRYMORE<br />
</h3>

<p>
The streets of London were red one day in
November, 1909, with placards proclaiming:
</p>

<p>
"The Lords declare Civil War!"
</p>

<p>
I suppose the Radicals thought it paid to force
the note.  Mr. Winston Churchill was their
bandmaster for the moment.  There is no more
effective political rhetorician, provided you accept
that fallacy about the folly of the people against
which the warning of Mr. Lincoln passes unheeded.
</p>

<p>
But there was, at least on one side, a state of
feeling in the country comparable to nothing I
can remember except the feeling which prevailed
during the Home Rule crisis, and far stronger now
than then.  In that crisis also the Lords came to
the rescue of the Kingdom, which they saved from
disintegration and ruin.  Ruin for the moment it
would have been; only to be finally averted by
the reconquest of Ireland.  Even to the spectator
those were stirring days.  England and Ireland
from 1881 onward had become the Wild West.
The revolver was the real safeguard of personal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P254"></a>254}</span>
liberty.  I don't think it will be quite like that
now, but it does seem as if the bitterness of
contention and the personalities of politics would go
further now than then; perhaps have already gone
further.
</p>

<p>
I was in Ireland for a fortnight during one of
the worst periods, but there were times when
London was as disturbed and distressful as Ireland
itself.  Those were years of dynamite in England,
when, as Lord Randolph Churchill said, the railway
stations were flying about our ears, and when
London Bridge came near being blown up, and
when Englishmen in high place were targets.
From the Prime Minister down to his youngest
colleague, no man was safe without a guard of
detectives; and not then.  Mr. Gladstone, whose
courage was high, shook off his escort whenever
he could.  Other Ministers paid more respect to
a very real danger.  Sir George Trevelyan, who
was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1882,
submitted sensibly to the precautions the Home
Office and Scotland Yard thought needful.  One
afternoon I met Trevelyan in a Bond Street shop.
We left the shop together.  Two quite
innocent-looking men were outside the door.  "I hope you
don't mind," said Trevelyan.  "I am obliged to
let them follow me."  They were Scotland Yard
detectives.  As we walked down the street they
were within earshot all the way, their vigilance
unrelaxing.  Whether they thought their ward
in greater or less danger because I was with him
I cannot say.  We parted at the corner of Piccadilly.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P255"></a>255}</span>
In both streets the throng on the sidewalk
was dense, but through it these men made
their way without violence, without haste, but
never for an instant allowing themselves to be
separated from the Chief Secretary by so much
as an arm's length.  He walked in peril not only
real but imminent.  Two days before his appointment
as Chief Secretary his predecessor, Lord
Frederick Cavendish, and Mr. Burke, permanent
Under Secretary, had been murdered.  To accept
that inheritance of probable assassination was
a gallant act, quite characteristic of Sir George
Trevelyan.  But I do not imagine that he or his
friends ever while he held that office forgot what
had happened in Phoenix Park.
</p>

<p>
Not many evenings later I met Sir George
Trevelyan at dinner.  If he had not been famous
as a writer and Member of Parliament and Irish
Secretary and much else, he might well have been
famous as a diner-out.  He had the art of conversation.
His uncle's influence had left him, in this
respect, untouched.  Where Macaulay discoursed
and reeled off dreary pages of encyclopædic
knowledge, Trevelyan talked lightly and well; claiming
no monopoly, preaching no sermon, wearying no
company too well bred to show itself bored.  He
had a felicity of allusion which was so wholly free
from pedantry as to seem almost accidental.
His voice, like Browning's, was strident and his
laugh sometimes boisterous; but this was in
moments of excitement.
</p>

<p>
On this particular evening there was something
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P256"></a>256}</span>
besides his inspiriting talk which drew the
attention of the company.  So long as the ladies were
at table he talked with his wonted energy.  When
the dining-room door had closed on the last of
these departing angels Trevelyan sank into his
chair with a sigh, drew a revolver from the breast
pocket of his coat, laid it on the table and said to
his host:
</p>

<p>
"Pray forgive me, but if you knew how tired I
am of carrying this thing about!"
</p>

<p>
On Sir George Trevelyan as on others the Irish
Secretaryship left its mark.  A year of office aged
him as if it were ten.  He came out worn and
grey: not yet forty-five years old.  The tragedy
was in one particular a tragi-comedy.  Half his
moustache had turned white; the other half black
as before.  And I suppose it shook his nerve more
or less and was perhaps responsible for that
fickleness of purpose or of view which led him first to
oppose and then to adopt Mr. Gladstone's policy
of Home Rule.
</p>

<p>
I saw one side of the Irish question during a
visit to Lord Barrymore, then Mr. Smith-Barry,
and his beautiful American wife, at Fota Island,
near Queenstown.  Mr. William O'Brien had
launched shortly before this his New Tipperary
scheme, of which one main object was to ruin
Mr. Smith-Barry who owned the old Tipperary.
Assassination was then only a political incident or
instrument.  Mr. Smith-Barry, moreover, was
hated not only as a landowner but for having
organized the one efficient defence against the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P257"></a>257}</span>
spoliation of the landlords which down to that
time had been discovered.  He had formed a
company and raised a large sum of money among
his English friends, he himself being the largest
contributor.  So he held the O'Brien cohorts at
bay; at what money cost and at what personal
risk few men knew.  But I apprehend that but for
Mr. Smith-Barry the Plan of Campaign and New
Tipperary would have succeeded and the South of
Ireland been handed over to the Land League.
</p>

<p>
One night as I was on my way from my room
to the drawing-room, on the other side of the hall,
I saw by the front door a big man in a blue cavalry
cloak and cap, who had just entered.  He was
laying aside his cloak as I passed, and took
out of their holsters first one and then another
navy revolver, both seven-shooters.  I said, too
flippantly:
</p>

<p>
"You take good care of yourself."
</p>

<p>
He turned on me sharply, with a questioning
look of keen eyes under heavy eyebrows:
</p>

<p>
"Are you a friend of Smith-Barry?"
</p>

<p>
"I should hardly be staying in his house if I
were not."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will tell you how you can best prove
your friendship.  Get him to carry what I carry."
</p>

<p>
"Is he in danger?"
</p>

<p>
"Danger?  There's a detective at this moment
behind every tree about the house, and even so
we don't know what may happen.  We hope he is
safe here at home, but he goes about unarmed,
and it is known he is unarmed, and no man who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P258"></a>258}</span>
does that can be sure of his life.  We have tried
our best to make him take care of himself.  He
will not.  Now do you try."
</p>

<p>
This sudden outburst, this appeal, this flash of
light upon the scene were all impressive.  The
big man, it turned out, was the Chief Constable
of the county.  He knew whereof he spoke.  I
promised to do what I could and I talked with
Mr. Smith-Barry.
</p>

<p>
He was a man equally remarkable for courage
and for coolness, but in matters affecting his
personal safety he did not use the judgment for which
in other matters he was distinguished.  He could
not be persuaded that anybody would think it
worth while to kill him.  He knew well enough
that the shooting of landlords had become a
popular pastime, but he could not, or would not,
understand why he himself should be shot.
</p>

<p>
"I am on good terms with my tenants; my
rents are fair rents; I evict nobody.  What have
they to gain by shooting me?"
</p>

<p>
But it was not from his own tenants that trouble
was expected.  It was not because Mr. Smith-Barry
was not a good landlord, but because he was
the leader of the landlords in the South of Ireland,
and the most formidable opponent of the League
that his life was threatened.  "It may be so,"
he said: "but I think I will go on as I am."  And
from that nobody could move him.
</p>

<p>
Now, as it happened, shortly before I left
London I had met one of the chief officials in the
Home Office who said to me:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P259"></a>259}</span>
</p>

<p>
"You are going to Ireland."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but how do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind how I know.  What I want to say
to you is, Take a revolver with you."
</p>

<p>
I was on the point of making a light answer,
but stopped.  If you get a hint of that kind from
a man who rules over the Criminal Department of
the Home Office and the police generally, you
accept it and do as you are told.  I had a revolver
with me, therefore, and when the time came to go
back to London I left it in its case on Mr. Smith-Barry's
writing-table, with a letter asking him to
accept it from me and once more begging him to
carry it if only that it might be known that he
carried it, or if only out of his friendship to me.
This prevailed.  He wrote me that he still thought
we made a needless fuss about it, but he could not
refuse the gift and he could not refuse to carry it.
No letter ever pleased me more.  I have never
again seen my friend the Chief Constable, but I
have never forgotten him, and I think of him
now as a fine impersonation of that authority of
the law which, in those turbulent days, he asserted
and successfully maintained against great odds.

CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><br />
SIR WILFRID LAURIER AND THE ALASKA BOUNDARY
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
The name of Empire-builder is used freely of
late, perhaps too freely.  It is so great a
name that it ought to be kept for the great men,
for the real builders and creators; for Clive, for
Rhodes, and their like.  There is another class,
somewhat more numerous, but not much, who
keep together the great Imperial patrimony which
others have handed down to them.  They might
perhaps be called Wardens of Empire, of whom
Sir Wilfred Laurier may stand for an example.
</p>

<p>
My memories of Sir Wilfrid Laurier go back to
those years when the Alaska boundary dispute
between Canada and the United States approached
its crisis.  Lord Minto was then Governor-General
of Canada; Mr. McKinley was President of the
United States; Mr. Hay was the American Secretary
of State.  There was strong feeling on both
sides.  It appeared later that it was stronger in
Canada than in the United States, but in both
countries there was hot blood and in both the
controversy turned in part upon gold.  We were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P261"></a>261}</span>
carrying on under a <i>modus vivendi</i>; a state of things
which tended to tranquillize the minds of men.
But the <i>modus vivendi</i> did not cover the whole of
the Alaskan territory then in dispute, and there
was anxiety both at Washington and Ottawa.
</p>

<p>
I went to Ottawa on a visit, spent a week at
Government House, and there first came to know
Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who had been Prime Minister
of the Dominion since 1896.  First impressions
are best and I set down my first impressions,
though they do not much differ from the last, and
though, in one way, they were wholly deceptive
and misleading.
</p>

<p>
For Sir Wilfrid came so softly into the drawing-room
at Government House that you would never
have thought him a leader of men.  He had something
of the ecclesiastic about him, and something
of the diplomatist.  The first perhaps suggested
itself because he was a Roman Catholic, and to
that faith all my Puritan prejudices were alien.
As I think it over, I know of no fact in the current
history of the British Empire more significant than
the fact that the greatest Dominion of this great
British and Protestant Power should have been
governed for thirteen years by a Roman Catholic
and a Frenchman.  That is Catholicism in its
broadest sense, and not in the sense of mere loyalty
to a Pope and to a particular Church.  Taking
the population of Canada as something over six
millions to-day, nearly one half are Roman
Catholics.  The other half are implacable Protestants.
How are they to live together in amity?  But they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P262"></a>262}</span>
do, and one of the reasons of this amity is Sir
Wilfrid Laurier.  If he were a leader of men in the
military sense, or as Chatham was a leader, one of
two things would have happened.  Quebec and
Ontario would have quarrelled, or Sir Wilfrid
would have ceased to be Prime Minister.  Booted
and spurred and in the saddle&mdash;not so is Canada
to be ruled, nor are the conflicting interests and
sentiments of the eastern and western sections of
the great Dominion so to be harmonized.  But
the smooth subtlety of the priest and the suavity
of the diplomatist are means of conciliation.
Thus, I imagine, has Sir Wilfrid worked.
</p>

<p>
Thus does he present himself to the company at
Government House.  He glides into the room.
He is not humble; far from it, but his is perhaps
the pride which apes humility.  Sweetness enters
with him, and light, if I may once more unite
rather overworked substantives which have come
down to us from Swift.  He does light up the room
as he enters, and the faces of those who are already
in it.  His coming is a delight to everybody and
now we know what is before us.
</p>

<p>
His manner as he receives and returns the
greetings of his friends is distinctly French.
After all the guests have arrived and the
Governor-General and Lady Minto have entered the room,
Sir Wilfrid's homage to the representative of the
sovereign and to Lady Minto has an essentially
Parisian elegance.  Nobody would mistake him
for an Englishman by birth or race.  He is English
politically and officially; none more loyal to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P263"></a>263}</span>
the King of England and England herself than he;
but personally he is French; taller, however, than
the average Frenchman, and of a larger frame.
The head is well set, the forehead broad and high,
a soft light in the eyes till something is said which
sets them burning, the mouth firm, and the whole
face, in contour and expression, quite as much
that of the man of thought as action.  There are
not many men of whom another man uses the
word charm but Sir Wilfrid is one; and women use
it of him more freely still.
</p>

<p>
He talked easily and well.  He speaks English
and French with equal fluency, with finish also,
and is never at a loss for an idiomatic phrase.
Yet the English is not quite the English heard
to-day in London, nor is his French Parisian.  The
Canadians have, in addition to many other kinds,
the patriotism of language.  Quebec has its own
French, the French of the eighteenth century or of
Touraine to-day; and Toronto its own English,
also now and then slightly archaic.  Yet in
Toronto dwells, and has long dwelt, the first of
living writers of living English.  I mean
Mr. Goldwin Smith; the fires of his intellectual youth
still, at eighty-three, unquenched, and by another
paradox the English author of the best political
history of the United States.  Canada does not
like his Canadian views, but they remain his views,
just as he, for all his Canadian residence remains
English.[<a id="chap28fn1text"></a><a href="#chap28fn1">1</a>]  Perhaps it is part of Sir Wilfrid's
diplomacy that he practises both these varieties
of French and English speech.  He takes liberties
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P264"></a>264}</span>
with each language, as a man who is master of
both is entitled to, and in each his soft tones are
persuasive.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap28fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap28fn1text">1</a>] Mr. Smith died, June, 1910.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Nothing seemed to come amiss to him.  The
social topics of Ottawa have not quite the same
range as in London, but to the people of Ottawa
they are not less engrossing.  Even scandal was
not unknown in those days, and gossip floated
about, and sometimes politics came to the top,
as they will anywhere when they are not too
trivial, and even when they are.  Ottawa was,
at any rate, with its fifty thousand people and its
lumber trade, the capital of Sir Wilfrid's kingdom.
Parliament was sitting in that finely placed
Parliament House crowning the cliff on the river, and
all Canada was there, in the substantial persons of
its delegates and Ministers.  Before I left I came
to know all, or nearly all, the Ministers.
Lunching one day with Sir Wilfrid at the Rideau Club,
I found myself in a group of a dozen or more
political personages, all, I think, in office.  They
struck me as able men with a gift of businesslike
talk.  But there were not two Sir Wilfrid Lauriers.
The long reign of Sir John Macdonald had not
proved fertile in new men.  Sir John was a sort
of Canadian Diaz, and had done for the Dominion
not what the President of the great Central
American Republic had done for Mexico, but a service
not less personal and individual.  Both had been
dictators.  Both had known how to use the forms
of representative government in such a way as
to consolidate and perpetuate arbitrary personal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P265"></a>265}</span>
power, and for something like the same period.
In a way, Sir Wilfrid has done a similar thing, only
you never could think a Minister of these endearing
manners arbitrary.  There is a more important
difference still.  Sir John Macdonald had organized
political corruption into a system.  Sir Wilfrid
is free from any such imputation as that.  Charges
have been heard against some of his Ministers;
never against Sir Wilfrid.
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps by accident that we began to
discuss the Alaska boundary; or perhaps not by
accident.  I do not know.  Thinking the matter
over afterward, it seemed possible enough that
Sir Wilfrid had shaped events in his own mind
from the first.  He may have been glad of an
opportunity to communicate with Washington
indirectly and unofficially, or desirous that the
President should know what was in his mind and
learn it otherwise than via London.  He was very
anxious as well he might be.  I had lately been in
Washington and knew pretty well the views of
the President and of Mr. Hay.  I had made two
or three visits to Ottawa before the Alaska
conversations with Sir Wilfrid took place.  In the
interval Mr. McKinley had ceased to be President.
He had been murdered by a foreigner with an
unpronounceable name, and while the murderer was
waiting in his cell to be executed the American
women, suffragists of the militant kind, had sent
him, to quote an American writer, "flowers, jellies,
books, and sympathy."  The discipline of the
prison did not forbid these gifts.  Mr. Roosevelt
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P266"></a>266}</span>
had become President.  Mr. Hay remained Secretary
of State, perhaps with a hand less free than
he had under Mr. McKinley, who was aware that
he himself was not master of all subjects or perhaps
of any subject not essentially American.
</p>

<p>
When the moment came Sir Wilfrid began
casually enough, in a way that would have allowed
him to stop whenever he chose.  But he went on,
and after a talk at Government House one day
asked me to call on him at Parliament House on
the morrow.
</p>

<p>
There again the talk continued, and it was
followed by one still longer when Sir Wilfrid came
back to Government House next day with papers
and maps.  Over these we spent some hours.
There were few details in all the complicated Alaska
business which were not familiar to him; and of
the whole question he had a grasp which made
details almost unimportant.  His view struck me
as reasoned, detached, with a settled purpose
behind it.  He was quite ready for compromise.
I never knew a statesman anywhere who was not,
with the possible exception of the ninety-two
statesmen who compose the United States Senate.
For myself, I had to look two ways.  I was obliged,
that is, to understand both points of view, the
Canadian and the American, for I was then the
representative of <i>The Times</i> in the United States.
</p>

<p>
When we had gone over the whole matter I said
to Sir Wilfrid that I thought I understood his
opinions and the policy he desired to follow.  But
what was I to do?  Not a word of what he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P267"></a>267}</span>
said to me could have been intended for print, nor
can it be printed now, even after all these years and
after the settlement.  But some object he must have
had, and I asked him if I was at liberty to draw
any inference from these interviews.  I was leaving
Ottawa the next day.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to Washington?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Shall you see the President or Mr. Hay?"
</p>

<p>
"Both."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you think anything you have heard
here likely to interest the President or Mr. Hay,
I don't see why you should not discuss the matter
with them as you have with me, if they choose."
</p>

<p>
The story of what happened at Washington
I reserve for another chapter.  But Sir Wilfrid's
way of dealing with the subject on this occasion
may perhaps stand for an example of what I have
called his diplomatic manner.  He was not
over-solicitous about precedents or formalities.  He
was quite ready to avail himself of such opportunities
as chance offered him, and of such instruments
as came in his way.  His absolute good faith was
beyond question.  If his suggestions, or rather
the frank statement of his own view and of what
he was ready to do had proved acceptable at
Washington, he would have put them into official
shape, and there would presently have been a
dispatch from the Foreign Office to the State
Department, and history would have been differently
written.  Why this did not happen will appear
when the Washington end of the story is told.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P268"></a>268}</span>
</p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
Leaving Ottawa the day after the last of these
conversations with the Canadian Prime Minister,
I went to Washington.  There I saw both the
President and Mr. Hay.  I said, of course, I had
no authority to bind Sir Wilfrid Laurier to
anything, but I had a strong impression and this
impression I laid before them.  As a matter of
convenience I had drawn up a memorandum, of
which I had sent Sir Wilfrid Laurier a copy.  When
Mr. Hay asked me whether I had any notes of
my conversations with the Canadian Prime Minister
I handed him this memorandum; rather a long
document.  He wished it read to him, and it was.
Then we talked it over.  Mr. Hay said:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you will see the President.  I shall
see him also, but I think it will be better you
should make your statement to him separately."
</p>

<p>
My belief is that both of them would have been
disposed to consider the Canadian Prime Minister's
attitude a reasonable one, and if an official
proposal in that sense had been made, and if it
had rested with the President to say yes or no, he
would have accepted it.  But acceptance involved
a treaty, and what was the use of agreeing to a
treaty which had to run the gauntlet of the United
States Senate&mdash;"the graveyard of treaties"?  The
Senate at that time was in one of its most
irreconcilable moods.  In truth, the President had found
himself more than once in collision with the
Senate, and the moment was not propitious.  Certain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P269"></a>269}</span>
Senators, moreover, had fixed opinions as to the
proper disposition of this Alaska dispute, and from
these opinions it was known they would not
depart.  At another time, when I hope to have
something to say about Mr. Roosevelt, I may add a
little, though not much, to this brief account.  It
can never be treated except with great reserve.
</p>

<p>
I had told Sir Wilfrid when I said good-bye that
I feared the Senate would prove an invincible
obstacle to an agreement.  I saw the President
several times, and the whole matter was gone into.
After my last conversation with him, which did
not end till past one o'clock in the morning, I
wrote Sir Wilfrid that I saw no chance at present
of carrying the matter further.  He answered very
kindly but regretfully, and so all this ended;
without result for the time being.  I add only that
the sagacity of the Canadian, the statesmanlike
sagacity, impressed the President and Mr. Hay
alike.  If it had been possible to lay the whole
story before the Senate, it might have impressed
that body also.
</p>

<p>
But Jefferson's phrase about government by
newspapers applies, or part of it applies, to the
Senate, or shall I say to part of the Senate?
Whatever is known to the Senate soon becomes known
to the newspapers.  A single illustration will
suffice.  The Senate transacts executive business
in secret session.  The galleries are cleared; the
Press gallery as well as the others.  But within an
hour of the close of an executive session a full
abstract of its proceedings is in the hands of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P270"></a>270}</span>
Press agents.  Besides, I had no authority to
repeat what Sir Wilfrid had said to anybody but
the President and Mr. Hay.  Sir Wilfrid is a man
so free from official pedantry or even conventionalities
that I think it likely he would have agreed
to an informal communication to the Senate, but
he was not asked.  There was no occasion to ask
him.  The objections were too evident.  Mr. Hay
said: "Anything I favour the Senate will
oppose."
</p>

<p>
Of the President some very leading Senators
were not less suspicious.  There was to be no
agreement until the Senate could dictate terms.
The subsequent agreement for an Alaska Boundary
Commission was a Senate agreement.  It did
not provide for arbitration.  If it had, the Senate
would have rejected it.  It was not supposed that
a tribunal composed of three members from each
side would reach a decision.  All men now know
that if it did it was because the Lord Chief Justice
of England conceived it to be his duty to vote in
accordance with the facts and the law.  He had
not laid aside his judicial character when he
became a Commissioner.
</p>

<p>
As it was Lord Alverstone's vote which turned
the scale in favour of the United States, the
Canadians attacked him with bitterness.  He
made one reply, and one only, and even this had no
direct reference to Canada.  Speaking at a dinner
in London he said: "If when any kind of arbitration
is set up they don't want a decision based on
the law and the evidence, they must not put a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P271"></a>271}</span>
British judge on the commission."  Writing as an
American I think it due to Lord Alverstone to say
that nothing ever did more to convince Americans
of British fairness than his act.  It was his act also
that put to rest a controversy which, in the opinion
of Canadian statesmen and American statesmen
alike, contained elements of the gravest danger
to peace.  If he had done nothing else he would
take his place in history as a great Lord Chief
Justice.
</p>

<p>
The Briton is so constituted that it is probable
he admires Lord Alverstone, formerly Richard and
then Sir Richard Webster, almost as much for his
renown in sport as for his professional eminence,
of which to be Tubman and then Postman in the
Court of Exchequer was one part.  He was, and
is, an athlete, and used to win running races, and
perhaps still could, being now only sixty-seven
years of age.  You used always to hear him spoken
of as "Dick Webster."  At Cambridge University
he had such eminence in the study of mathematics
as entitled him to be thirty-fifth Wrangler; and
in the more humane letters so much proficiency
as made him third-class classic.  In the Schools,
that is, he was less energetic than on the track.
</p>

<p>
But success at the Bar does not depend on the
Differential Calculus or on Latin and Greek.
Within ten years after being called he was Q.C.,
and having found a seat in Parliament, became
Attorney-General in Lord Salisbury's Government
in 1885-6.  Within seventeen years he had reached
the highest unjudicial place in his profession.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P272"></a>272}</span>
He held the same office three times; then was made
Master of the Rolls; the judge who in point of
dignity comes next after the Lord Chancellor and
the Lord Chief Justice, and finally, in 1900, Lord
Chief Justice of England.  During his service at
the Bar he had been a great patent lawyer; with an
income which rumour put at £30,000, or $150,000;
for this country perhaps the maximum, outside
of the parliamentary Bar.  Such is a bare outline
of the career, in all respects distinguished,
honourable, stainless, of the man on whom Canada
poured out criticisms which did not stop short of
vituperation.  They need no answer.  If they
did, it is not my place to answer them.  Not
one human being in England believed Lord
Alverstone capable of the dishonesty which the
Canadian papers imputed to him.
</p>

<p>
I am afraid I must add that Sir Wilfrid Laurier
was one of Lord Alverstone's critics.  The feeling
throughout Canada was so strong that he had
perhaps no choice, or no choice but between that
and either resignation or defeat.  No pilot could
weather that storm.  The feeling of Canada was
emotional.  What he said, he said as Prime
Minister.  Yet whether as Prime Minister or as Sir
Wilfrid Laurier he must have rejoiced in the
settlement; even though it were at the expense of
Canadian claims.  I do not think Canada had any
valid claims, or had a case which before any
impartial tribunal could have been maintained.  But
whether she had or not, it was for her interest
to see them once for all swept away and peace
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P273"></a>273}</span>
and good feeling established between her and her
neighbour.
</p>

<p>
Our Canadian friends must have been aware at
the time that they stood alone.  In their attacks
on Lord Alverstone they had no backing in England.
No English newspaper ever suggested that Lord
Alverstone had voted otherwise than according to
his conscience.  England knew him to be
incorruptible and unassailable, and laughed at the
suggestion that he did not understand the Canadian
claims.  It was because he understood them
that he decided against them.
</p>

<p>
The English, it is true, have thought themselves
unlucky in arbitrations, and have fallen into the
habit of expecting an adverse decision from an
arbitration tribunal.  The Geneva tribunal
instilled into them that reluctant expectation.  But
as this was not an arbitration but simply a
Commission for determining the true boundary line of
Alaska, they accepted in a sporting spirit the
judgment of their own Lord Chief Justice.  How
could they do otherwise?  On the constitution of
the tribunal, and on the claims of Senator Lodge
and Senator Turner to be impartial, they had
remarks to make.  On the other hand, were the
Canadian members impartial?
</p>

<p>
There can be no harm now in saying that Sir
Wilfrid looked upon the Alaskan situation with
gloomy forebodings.  So did everybody on both
sides of the border; everybody who understood
the situation and would give himself the trouble to
think, and had a sense of responsibility.  In the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P274"></a>274}</span>
disputed belt of territory, Alaskan territory which
the United States claimed and Canada claimed,
gold might at any moment be discovered.  There
would come a rush from both sides.  We all know
what the gold-miners are&mdash;a rough lot, not always
recognizing any law but the law of the strongest
and the most covetous.  They make laws for
themselves, and even those they do not keep.
Many of them are desperate, many ruined, many
outlaws; many have no other hope than in finding
gold somewhere and getting it anyhow.  They are
all armed.  Revolvers are the arbitrators whose
decisions they respect.  In the presence of
new-found gold, what are boundaries or titles or
international relations?  Inevitably they would cross
the border into the debatable land, Canadians and
Americans alike.  What would the flag mean to
bankrupt gamblers who saw once more the hope
of riches?  There would be disputes.  There would
be collisions.  At any moment a shot might be
fired, and then what?  The risk was awful.
</p>

<p>
This, I have no doubt, was the risk Sir Wilfrid
had in mind.  It meant nothing less than the
possibility of war between Great Britain and the
United States.  Gold once discovered, the
possibility became a probability.  Could a Canadian
statesman, could an American statesman, think
of that hazard and not be willing to do much, or
even to concede much, in order to avert it?  Yet
of all the men of both nationalities with whom, then
and after, I have talked about Alaska, Sir Wilfrid
alone had a clear view of the danger, and he alone
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P275"></a>275}</span>
was willing to do what was absolutely necessary to
make war impossible.  For that reason he stands
forth a great patriot, a great Canadian, a great
Englishman.  World-wide as is his fame he deserves
a greater.  It is not yet possible to do him
full justice.  It may never be.  But his views and
proposals and large wisdom, as they were set forth
in these conversations, put him, in my opinion,
in the very front rank of statesmen of his time.
The impression they made on the President and
Mr. Hay was profound.  They too were statesmen
but their hands were tied.
</p>

<p>
It is further to be borne in mind that the
North-western border was in a ferment.  That great
belt of powerful States conterminous with Canada
had long nursed its grievances.  The Alaska
question did not stand alone.  It never has.  There
were questions of duties, of tariffs, of lumber rights,
of the rights of lake and canal navigation, of
fisheries, Atlantic and Pacific, and many
others&mdash;thirteen specific subjects in all.  They had once
been all but settled.  The High Commissioners in
the last conference at Washington had come to
terms on all but Alaska when, in an unlucky
moment, Lord Herschell, believing he could force
the hand of the Americans, put forth an ultimatum
out of a blue sky.  It must be all or none.  There
must be no settlement which does not include
Alaska.  Lord Herschell had been thought of a
contentious mind all through.  Americans bore
with that, but to an ultimatum, an agreement at
the mouth of a gun, we would not submit.  So
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P276"></a>276}</span>
the whole went off.  What was the result?  There
came a time when Sir Wilfrid himself had to
announce that there would be no more pilgrimages
to Washington.  Nor have there been.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><br />
ANNEXING CANADA&mdash;LADY ABERDEEN&mdash;LADY MINTO
</h3>

<p>
The first person from whom I heard of the
American immigration into Canada was Sir
Wilfrid Laurier.  He told me it had begun quietly,
a few American farmers drifting across the border
in search of better and cheaper land than could be
had at home.  There was no sound of drum or
trumpet.  These men had nothing to do with the
talk of annexation.  They had no political object.
Their object was agricultural; only that and nothing
more.  It is possible enough that the reputed
riches of the North-west province of Canada had
something to do with the policy, if it can be called
a policy, of the American annexationists, desiring
to fire the hearts of the farmers in Illinois and
Minnesota who saw the yield of their wheat
lands diminishing yearly.  It seems never to have
occurred to the politicians that the farmers were
quite capable of looking after their own interests,
and that it was cheaper to buy land than to make
war for it.
</p>

<p>
The movement had, at the time of this conversation
in 1902, been going on for years.  Beginning
by scores, it had risen to hundreds yearly, then
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P278"></a>278}</span>
thousands.  Sir Wilfrid computed that there were
altogether some fifty or sixty thousand American
settlers in the Canadian North-west, and that the
yearly exodus from "the States" had reached six
thousand.
</p>

<p>
"But does not that raise or threaten to raise a
political issue?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it is much too soon to think of that."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I imagine Sir Wilfrid did think
of it, and it may have been present to Lord Grey's
mind when he launched his memorable declaration
at the Waldorf Hotel two years later.  Now, the
number of Americans who are moving northward
and acquiring Canadian soil is computed at a
hundred thousand yearly or more.  The political
difficulty, if there were one, would seem to be met
by the Canadian law allowing aliens to hold land
but requiring them to become Canadians at the
end of three years.  I am told there is such a law
but I do not know.
</p>

<p>
In truth, the political difficulty has never
outgrown manageable limits.  There has always been
more or less "tall talk" about annexing Canada.
Eloquent phrases have been heard&mdash;"One continent,
one flag," or "the Stars and Stripes from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle."  But no
party has taken up this cry.  One newspaper in
New York, <i>The Sun</i>, did for a time preach annexation.
<i>The Sun</i> is a journal which does not disdain
sensations, and has taught its readers to expect
them, and from time to time fulfils the expectations
it excites.  The editor at that time was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P279"></a>279}</span>
Mr. Paul Dana, son of the Mr. Charles A. Dana who
made <i>The Sun</i> a powerful journal.  Mr. Paul Dana
started a society to promote the acquisition of
Canada.  The capital of the society was $125,000,
or £25,000.  That was the sum which Mr. Paul
Dana and his friends thought sufficient, or were
able to raise, if they did raise it, to sever from the
British Empire a Dominion larger than the United
States without Alaska, capable, in military
opinion, of self-defence, but, in any case, with the
military and naval power of Great Britain behind
it.  Mr. Paul Dana, however, did not pursue
matters to the bitter end.  He has ceased to be
editor of <i>The Sun</i> and Canada remains British.
I do not know whether his annexation society is
still in existence.  But the American appetite for
Canada, never keen, has grown duller still.  Men's
minds turn to other things.  The Philippines and
Hawaii and Porto Rico and the defence of the
Pacific Coast are more than enough to occupy our
attention.  The Senate itself has grown tractable,
and on the chief points of difference an agreement
has been reached where five years ago no agreement
seemed possible.
</p>

<p>
Two years after Sir Wilfrid Launer became
Prime Minister the somewhat agitated and
perhaps agitating Governor-Generalship of Lord
Aberdeen came to an end.  I suppose the cause
of the troubled waters on which that particular
ship of State was tossed was not to be found wholly
or mainly in Lord Aberdeen himself, but in the
multitudinous energies of Lady Aberdeen.  Her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P280"></a>280}</span>
convictions were strong, her zeal was continuous,
her certainty of being in the right was a certainty
she shared with her sex, or with all those women
who think public affairs their proper sphere.
She had many admirable qualities and a courage
which shrank from no adventure merely because it
was an adventure.
</p>

<p>
Her zeal in the cause of Home Rule for Ireland
is well known.  It had been shown in Dublin.  It
was shown now at Ottawa.  It crossed the border
and hung out a flag in Chicago.  In the Chicago
Exhibition, or, as it was officially called, the
"World's Columbian Exposition," in 1893, there
was, among other attractions, an Irish village.
This village Lady Aberdeen took under her patronage,
and over it she hoisted an Irish flag of the
kind in which the Home Rule heart rejoices; a flag
with the Harp but without the Crown.  If Lady
Aberdeen had done this as a private individual
it could hardly have been allowed to pass.  But
she did it as wife of the Governor-General of the
Dominion of Canada.  There were official
remonstrances and the flag was lowered.  Against
an indiscretion of that kind may be set many
useful and charitable enterprises, begun or
encouraged by this lady in Ottawa and all over
Canada.  She is kindly remembered there, and
her visits to Canada since Lord Aberdeen ceased
to be Governor-General have been welcomed.
But there are many stories of her crusading spirit
besides the one I have told, and I suppose the
Canadians really like to live a more peaceful life
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P281"></a>281}</span>
than they were allowed to when Lady Aberdeen
ruled over them.
</p>

<p>
Lord Minto succeeded Lord Aberdeen.  Sir
Wilfrid Laurier was Prime Minister during the
whole of Lord Minto's term, and Mr. Chamberlain
was Secretary for the Colonies down to the last
year.  I suppose it may be remarked that seldom
have three great officials worked in a harmony
more complete than did these three.  It can
hardly be necessary to say anything of Mr. Chamberlain
except this; that his masterfulness never
made itself felt in Canada in such a way as to
weaken, but always in such a way as to strengthen,
the tie between the Motherland and the Colony.
His Imperialism took account of the Dominion
as well as of the Empire; it took equal account for
all purposes.  It was under this strong hand that
Canada felt her independence, perhaps for the
first time, completely safeguarded.
</p>

<p>
Between Lord Minto and Sir Wilfrid Laurier
there was on all subjects an understanding.  That
is not the same thing as saying they never differed,
which would be absurd.  But they had before
them the same high objects, and they pretty well
agreed as to the means of attaining them.  The
relations between Government House and
Parliament House, where the Prime Minister had his
headquarters, were cordial, frank, unrestrained,
and delightful.  That there should be relations
of that kind between the representative of the
Crown and the representative of the Dominion
is of equal advantage to the Crown and to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P282"></a>282}</span>
Dominion.  They have not always existed, but
there seems every reason to believe they will
exist in the future, as they did in Lord Minto's
time, and as they do now that Lord Grey speaks
for the Sovereign and Sir Wilfrid Laurier is still
the trusted Prime Minister of a Dominion which
has grown too great to be called a Colony.
</p>

<p>
As I have mentioned Lady Aberdeen, I may
say a word, though for a different reason, about
Lady Minto, who for six years was the idol of
Ottawa and of the whole Dominion.  If ever there
was an example of tact and felicity in the discharge
of the duties that fall to the wife of a Governor-General,
Lady Minto was that example.  What
need be added except that the statement is not
a compliment but a testimony?  The Canadian
Press has paid its tribute and there are other
tributes.  One is that in Quebec and Toronto, the
capital of the French Roman Catholic province
and the capital of the British Protestant province,
Lady Minto was equally popular and equally
beloved.  In a very literal but strictly correct and
conventional sense it may be said that she was a
power in the Dominion.  The receptions at
Government House were very interesting; perhaps
sometimes curious as an example of democracy
undergoing a social evolution.  In all the
Commonwealths beyond the seas the same process, I
presume, may be studied.  When Lady Carrington
issued three thousand invitations to a reception
at Government House in Sydney the limit had
perhaps been reached for the time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P283"></a>283}</span>
</p>

<p>
There can be no such throng at Government
House in Ottawa because it is not large enough;
perhaps is not quite large enough for the dignity
of the Dominion in these days of its amazing
growth and ever-increasing importance.  But
Ottawa, though a flourishing city, is not a great
city.  It is a compromise capital; the middle
term in which the rivalries of Quebec on the
one hand and Toronto on the other found a
means of peace on neutral and central ground.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br /><br />
TWO GOVERNORS-GENERAL&mdash;LORD MINTO AND LORD GREY
</h3>

<p>
Lord Minto has now passed from the great
post of Governor-General of the Dominion
to the still greater Viceroyalty of India.  But I
apprehend it will be long before his reign in Canada
is forgotten.  Possibly the Canadians might not
use, and may not like, the word reign.  They are
a susceptible as well as a great people.  They are
jealous of their liberties, which are in no danger,
and of the word American, to which they have
some claim, over-shadowed though it be by their
greater neighbour on the South.  I have seen
more instances than one of Canadian sensitiveness,
of which I will take the simplest.  Having
to pay for a purchase in an Ottawa shop I asked
the shopkeeper whether he would take an American
banknote.  He answered with a flushed face:
</p>

<p>
"We consider our money as much American as
yours.  We have the same right as you to the
name American."
</p>

<p>
"By all means.  But what do you call our
money?"
</p>

<p>
"United States bills."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you call me?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P285"></a>285}</span>
</p>

<p>
But to that simple question he had no answer
ready.  And I rather imagine the time has come,
or is coming, when the Canadian may be as proud
of the name which identifies him with the northern
half of the continent as we are of the adjective
we have to share, more or less, with others.  I
never heard of a Mexican calling himself an
American, but I believe the Latin races to the South
do; and forget sometimes to put South before it.
Lord Minto was Governor-General while
Mr. Chamberlain was Colonial Secretary, a period of
transition, of Imperial transition, to which
Mr. Chamberlain led the way.  Nobody has ever
forgotten his adjuration to all Englishmen to
think imperially.  As I remember Canada during
several visits, she was at that time more inclined
to think independently.  Not that any party
in the Dominion meditated a secession from the
Empire, but there was a pretty distinct notion,
and claim, of colonial autonomy.  Canada came
first, as Canada, and not as a part of the Empire.
The moment when Imperial considerations first
became dominant in the Canadian mind was
moment of the Boer War.
</p>

<p>
There it is that Lord Minto's name becomes
indissolubly allied with the Dominion.  His share
in that great transaction of the Canadian contingent
to South Africa has never, I think, been fully
understood by the British public.  Nor would it
ever be if the matter were left to him.  He was
never a man to advertise himself or his deeds.
I dare say he will not like my telling the story,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P286"></a>286}</span>
though I shall tell it only as it was told to me, and
the teller had nothing to do with Government
House.
</p>

<p>
It was for a while doubtful whether Canada
would send troops.  There was, I am told, an
uncertain feeling about the militia organization,
then on a different footing from the present.  There
were awkward stories of corruption and inefficiency.
It was doubted whether a force officered
and equipped in conditions then existing would
do credit to the Dominion.  There were hesitations
on other grounds.  But when finally a levy
was voted, Lord Minto, who had taken no part
in the discussion and could take none, availed
himself of his authority as Governor-General and
of his experience as a soldier, and gave his personal
attention to the organization of the contingent.
It was stated to me much more strongly than that,
and my informant seemed to doubt whether Lord
Minto did not exceed, or at least strain, his
prerogatives as representative of the Crown.  If he
did, so much the better.  The English have ever
liked a servant in high place who was not afraid of
responsibilities.  But for my purpose it is enough
to say that Lord Minto took an active part in
these momentous preparations.  I think no officer
was appointed without his sanction, no contract
for supplies entered into which he did not approve,
no arrangement of any kind made but upon his
initiative or with his express consent.
</p>

<p>
The result was that the Canadian forces reached
Africa a body of soldiers fit for the field,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P287"></a>287}</span>
not as a mere aggregation of men food for powder.
England knows, and all the world knows, what
service they did.  There were no better troops
of the kind, perhaps not many of any kind better
adapted for the work they had to do and for coping
with such an enemy as the Boers.  They did
more than their contract called for in the field.
They builded better than they knew.  They made
it plain to all men that the country which had
sent such troops as these many thousands of miles
beyond the seas to the relief of the Imperial forces
of Great Britain was itself an integral and
indispensable part of the Empire.
</p>

<p>
Whereas, if they had failed or only half
succeeded, they would have done little good to the
British arms in South Africa and none at all to
the Imperialism of which Canada to-day is a
bulwark.  And if this is a true account, as I believe
it to be, of the way in which these two great results
were brought about, the credit of them belongs
more to Lord Minto than to any other man.
</p>

<p>
I do not offer this as an explanation of the regard
in which Lord Minto was held.  It could not be an
explanation, because it was not generally known.
There were other reasons, at the top of which I
should put his common sense, his sincerity, and,
of course, that devotion to duty which every
Governor-General is presumed to possess, which
in him was conspicuous.  Everybody liked him,
nobody doubted him.  He made the interests of
Canada his own.  He traversed that vast territory
from end to end again and again.  He held a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P288"></a>288}</span>
Court not in Ottawa only, but in Quebec, in
Halifax, in Toronto, and in that Far North where
Canada touches Alaska and the chief harvest of
the soil is gold.  His five years' term came to an
end but the Colonial Office and Parliament House
and the people of Canada wished him to stay on,
and so the five years became six.  A period on
which to look back with pride.
</p>

<p>
Canada is again fortunate in her Governor-General,
and in his relations with those who mould
public opinion on the American side of the border.
I imagine it may not be known in England how he
first conquered the respect and good-will of the
Americans.  It was at a dinner of some five
hundred or six hundred people at the Waldorf Hotel
in New York.  In the course of his short speech
Lord Grey referred, with a plainness unusual in
those exalted regions, to what had been said in
times past about the possible absorption of
Canada by the United States.
</p>

<p>
"But now," observed the Governor-General,
"there is no more reason for discussing the
annexation of Canada by the United States than for
discussing the annexation of the United States
by Canada."
</p>

<p>
It was a straight hit from the shoulder, but the
audience rose to it and cheered him as I had
heard no Englishman cheered in New York before
that time.  He became in a moment a great figure,
filling the public eye.  He delivered his tremendous
sentence with simplicity and good humour.
There was nothing like defiance or menace.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P289"></a>289}</span>
Everybody saw that he felt himself on a level
with his hearers.  He spoke as Governor-General
of the Dominion to the people of the United States,
<i>d'égal à égal</i>.  He spoke as an Englishman to
Americans.  Mr. Price Collier may say, if he
chooses, that English and Americans do not like
each other, but I will ask him what other two
nationalities have the same, or anything like the
same, points of contact and of sympathy?  There
stood Lord Grey, just an Englishman, holding out
his hand to his American cousins.  If the hand
happened for that moment to be clenched it was
none the less a greeting, and was understood as
such.  You could not look into his face without
seeing in it the spirit of kinship and of friendship.
Lord Grey is pre-eminently one of those men who
think the best relations between men or between
communities must spring from frankness.  He
wanted to clear the ground, and he did clear it.
If he had asked anybody's advice he would
certainly have been advised not to say what he did.
He preferred to trust to his own instincts, and they
proved to be true instincts.  The danger was that
a freedom of speech which would be accepted
from his lips might be resented when read in cold
print.  But it was not.
</p>

<p>
No American will have forgotten Lord Grey's
gift of his portrait of Franklin to Philadelphia.
That endeared him to us still further.  It was a
prize of war which he surrendered, taken in the
War of the Revolution by General Sir Charles
Grey.  It used to hang near the ceiling in one of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P290"></a>290}</span>
the reception rooms of Howick House, Northumberland.
I saw it there some time before the gift
and Lord Grey told me its history, but did not tell
me he meant to give it back to America.  I
believe he did ask whether I thought Philadelphia
would care to have it again, a question to which
I could not but say yes.  Yet it might almost be
thought of the family, with a good deal more than
a hundred years of possession behind it.  But in
this country a hundred years do not count so
much as elsewhere.  The English have long since
got into the habit of reckoning by centuries.
</p>

<p>
When Lord Grey went to Washington the
President asked me to bring him to the White
House.  Mrs. Roosevelt had a reception that
evening and I said with her permission I would
bring him then.  "Very good," said the President,
"and mind you bring him to me as soon as
you come."  I did as I was told.  The President
greeted him, as he did everybody, warmly, but in
a way that made Lord Grey understand he was
welcome.  Within thirty seconds they were deep
in political economy, a matter of which Lord Grey
had made a profounder study than the President.
For the Englishman had not, like Bacon and
Mr. Roosevelt, taken all knowledge to be his province,
and was able to master his subjects.  More than
once I had occasion to see something of his familiarity
with difficult subjects&mdash;once at dinner when
the late Mr. Beit, the South African magnate, sat
on his right, and the two discussed financial and
political questions.  Mr. Beit had made a great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P291"></a>291}</span>
fortune in South Africa, and Lord Grey had not.
The Chartered Company had not then proved a
mine of wealth to its administrator.  But the
minds of the two were at one.  The knowledge of
each was immense.  The power of grappling with
great subjects was common to both.  Perhaps
Lord Grey sometimes took an imaginative view,
but the feet of the capitalist were planted on the
solid earth.
</p>

<p>
The President and the Governor-General became
friends at once, neither of the two being the
kind of man to whom friendship requires length
of years to come into being.  It is, of course, for
the interests of both Canada and the United
States that relations of sympathetic good-will
should exist between the rulers of each.  A few
hours before their meeting the President knew
nothing about Lord Grey.  Even to Mr. Roosevelt's
omniscience there are limits.  But he desired
to know, and when he had heard a little of
Lord Grey's history, said joyfully: "All right;
we have subjects in common and ideas too."  So
the doors of the White House opened wide to the
Governor-General, and Lord Grey was the President's
guest, and the impression in Canada was a
good impression.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI
<br /><br />
LORD KITCHENER&mdash;PERSONAL TRAITS AND INCIDENTS
</h3>

<p>
It does not appear that Lord Kitchener's refusal
to accept the Mediterranean post to which
he was assigned has impaired his popularity or
diminished the general confidence in him.  Possibly
even official confidence survives, in a degree.
The tone of the Prime Minister's replies to
questions about the refusal may denote resentment but
hardly censure.  So I think I may still venture to
reprint sundry personal reminiscences which were
written before this collision between the great
soldier and the Prime Minister&mdash;or was it the
War Minister?&mdash;had occurred.
</p>

<p>
"The greatest chief-of-staff living," said the
Germans of Lord Kitchener; possibly with a
reservation in favour of themselves.  They would
not go beyond that limited panegyric.  The
remark was made by a German officer, high in
rank, not long after the Boer war, and it was
Paardeberg which rankled in his German mind
and would not suffer him to award to the English
general a great power of leadership in the field.
But I believe German opinion on that battle has
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P293"></a>293}</span>
since undergone revision.  Whether it has or not
Lord Kitchener's military renown can easily take
care of itself; nor is it his soldiership which I am
going to discuss.  I happen to have met him now
and then, and what else I have to say about him is
personal.  I hope not too personal.
</p>

<p>
It was on a journey from London to Alderbrook,
Mr. Ralli's beautiful place in Sussex, that I first
saw Lord Kitchener.  We were a week-end party
and went down together in a saloon carriage.  The
figure which next to Lord Kitchener's stands out
clearest is the late Lord Glenesk's still in the vigour
of his versatile powers and accomplishments and
attractions.  The occasion was the more
interesting because Lord Kitchener had then lately
returned from Egypt, and from that victorious
campaign which he, and he alone, had planned and
carried through from beginning to end in strict
fulfilment of the scheme framed before the actual
preparations for it had been begun.  This also
might induce our German military friends to
reconsider that chief-of-staff opinion above quoted.
</p>

<p>
It was known that this second hero of Khartoum&mdash;Gordon
being the first&mdash;was to travel by this
train.  It was an express, and there was no stop
before Guildford.  But consider the enthusiasm
of the British people when they have a real hero.
The stations through which the train thundered at
forty miles an hour were crowded with people.
They could not get so much as a glimpse of their
idol, but they stood and cheered and waved their
hats to the train and the invisible hero-traveller.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P294"></a>294}</span>
</p>

<p>
When we reached Guildford six or seven thousand
people thronged that station.  They hurrahed for
"Kitchener," and as the cries for "Kitchener"
met with no response, they were raised again and
again.  Lord Kitchener sat in a corner, buried in a
rough grey overcoat, silent and bored.  He had
no taste for "ovations" and triumphal greetings.
Lord Glenesk told him he really must show
himself and acknowledge these salutations.  So Lord
Kitchener rose, with an ill grace, walked to one
of the open doors of the saloon, raised his hand
with a swift military jerk to his bowler, and
retreated.  The tumult increased but he would not
show himself a second time.  The cheers rolled on
without effect.  The idol would not be idolized.
It was not ill-temper but indifference.  He was
in mufti and it was the soldier the multitude
demanded to see.  In truth, Lord Kitchener's
appearance at the moment was not military.
It was remarked by his fellow-passengers that
he showed to little advantage in his grey clothes,
none too well fitting.  When evening came he
was another man, just as unmistakably the soldier
as if in full uniform.
</p>

<p>
He was at that time brooding over his Gordon
College scheme for Khartoum.  He wanted
£100,000, and he doubted whether he should get
it.  In vain his friends urged him to make his
appeal.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Lord Kitchener, "nothing less
than £100,000 will be of any use.  It is a large
sum.  I should not like to fail, and if they gave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P295"></a>295}</span>
me only part of the amount I should have to
return it."
</p>

<p>
He was told that his name would be enough.
It was the psychological moment.  Delay would
only injure his chances.  Lord Glenesk offered
him £1000 across the dinner table, and other sums
were offered there and then, and the support of
two powerful newspapers was promised.  Still he
hesitated, and still he repeated, "I should not
like to fail."  At last one of the company said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lord Kitchener, if you had doubted
about your campaign as you do about this you
would never have got to Khartoum."
</p>

<p>
His face hardened and his reply was characteristic
of the man:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not; but then I could depend on
myself and now I have to depend on the British
public."
</p>

<p>
But he did ask for the money and got all and
more than all he wanted with no difficulty
whatever.  It appeared that the British public also
was to be depended on.
</p>

<p>
The United States Government was at this
time in some perplexity about the Philippines,
where matters were not going well.  Lord Kitchener
asked what we were going to do about it and
how we meant to govern the 1200 islands.  He
seemed to think they were giving us more trouble
than they ought.  I explained that the business of
annexing territory on the other side of the globe
was a new one to us, that down to within a few
years the American Republic was self-contained,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P296"></a>296}</span>
that we had therefore no machinery for the
purpose, no civil or military servants intended or
trained for distant duties, no traditions, no
experience of any kind, and no men.  Whoever went
to the Philippines had to learn his business from
the beginning, and the business was a very
difficult one.
</p>

<p>
Lord Kitchener listened to all this, thought a
moment, looked across the table, and said: "I
should like to govern them for you."  And
although it was not said seriously and could not
be, it was evident that Lord Kitchener would very
well have liked to take over a job of that kind
had it been possible.  His mind turned readily
to executive, administrative, and creative work.
The task of reducing eight or nine millions of
Filipinos and other races to order was one for
which he was fitted.
</p>

<p>
Not long after that, an American who had
already once been Civil Governor of the Philippines
for a short time resumed that post and held it for
two years.  He won the confidence of the people.
Out of chaos he brought order.  He set up an
administrative system.  He treated the natives
justly.  He brought them to co-operate with their
rulers.  When he left, he left behind him a
Government incomparably better than the islands had
ever known.  Life, liberty, property, all civil and
personal rights, were protected.  Progress had
begun.  Trade and commerce had begun to
flourish and have continued to flourish so far as
tariff conditions permit.  Loyalty, a sentiment
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P297"></a>297}</span>
never before known, though a plant of slow growth,
prevails.  Rebellions are at an end.  The name
of the American who accomplished all this, or
laid the foundations of it all within two years,
is Taft.  He is now President of the United
States.
</p>

<p>
The last time I saw Lord Kitchener was at a
house in one of the Southern counties, in 1902.
He was then on his way to take up the
commandership-in-chief of India.  He drove over to luncheon
from another house some sixteen miles away.
Luncheon, usually at 1 o'clock, had been put off
till 1.30 because of the distance he and his friends
had to drive; a great concession.  But the roads
were heavy and they arrived just before 2.  Lord
Kitchener said to me as we were going in: "Look
at me.  I really cannot sit down to lunch in all
this dirt."  I suggested that he should come to
my room.  He did, and after spending ten minutes
on his toilet emerged looking not much less
the South African campaigner than when he began.
</p>

<p>
He said: "You don't seem to approve."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I was only wondering what you had been
doing for ten minutes.  But late as we are there
is one thing you must see."
</p>

<p>
And I took him to the hall where stand those
two figures in damascened armour inlaid with
gold, Anne de Montmorenci and the Constable
de Bourbon, whom a Herbert of the sixteenth
century had taken prisoners.  They woke the
soldier in this dusty traveller.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P298"></a>298}</span>
</p>

<p>
"If I were a Frenchman I think I should try
to get them back."
</p>

<p>
"It has been tried.  One of their descendants
offered £20,000 for the pair, but you see they are
still here."
</p>

<p>
We found the rest of the company at table, where
a place next his hostess was waiting for him.  If
you had seen Lord Kitchener for the first time you
would have felt that his toilet did not much
matter.  The man's personality was the thing.  There
are many men who produce an impression of power,
but with this man it was military power.  You could
not take him for anything but a soldier.  Not at
all the soldier as he presents himself to the
youthful imagination.  He was not in uniform; no
English soldier ever is except on duty or on
occasions of ceremony.  But it is possible to be a
soldier without gold lace or gilt buttons, and to
appear to be.  The carriage of his head, rising out
of square shoulders, announced him a soldier; so
did his pale grey-blue, steel-blue eyes, and the
air of command; a quite unconscious air for the
simplicity of his bearing was as remarkable as
anything about him.  It has been said he is not a
natural leader of men, not a man whom other men
follow in the field just because they cannot help it;
that he does not "inspire" his soldiers.  I doubt
it; but even were it so he is a man whose orders
other men must obey when they are sent.  His
pale steel-blue eyes have in them the hard light
of the desert.  I believe, in fact, the light of the
desert, which we consider a poetic thing, injured
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P299"></a>299}</span>
his eyes.  But there is in them that far-off look
as of one whose sight has ranged over great spaces
for great intervals of time.  The races of
South-eastern Europe and of Central Asia have it.
There has been seen in London a beautiful girl
who has it; gazing out, from the graceful movement
of the waltz, on a distant horizon much beyond
the walls of a ballroom.
</p>

<p>
Yet as Lord Kitchener sits there talking at
luncheon the hardness of the face softens.  The
merciless eyes grow kindly and human; you may
forget, if you like, the frontal attack at
Paardeberg and the corpse-strewn plains of Omdurman,
and remember only that an English gentleman who
has made a study of the science of war sits there,
devoting himself to the entertainment of two
English ladies.  It is a picture which has a charm
of its own.  And it is a Kitchener of whom you
hear none too often.  That is why you hear of
him in these social circumstances from me.  Most
men have a human side to them.  Even "K."
has, and sometimes allows it to be seen.
</p>

<p>
He had a human side when he departed without
leave from the Military Academy at Woolwich
to take a look for himself at what was going on
near the French frontier in July or August 1870,
when the Prussians were giving their French
neighbours a lesson in the art of war that
seemed to young Kitchener a lesson likely to be
more profitable than those of Woolwich; so he
went.  It was a grave breach of discipline.  I
never heard how the matter was settled but it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P300"></a>300}</span>
did not keep Kitchener out of the army for he
entered the Royal Engineers the next year.  But
I imagine we all like him the better for such an
adventure.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII
<br /><br />
  SIR GEORGE LEWIS&mdash;KING'S SOLICITOR AND FRIEND<br />
  A SOCIAL FORCE<br />
</h3>

<p>
Lord Russel said of him:
</p>

<p>
"What is most remarkable in Lewis is not
his knowledge of the law, which is very great, nor
his skill in the conduct of difficult causes, in which
he is unrivalled, nor his tact, nor his genius for
compromise.  It is his courage."
</p>

<p>
That was said not long after the Parnell trial,
in which Lord Russell&mdash;then Sir Charles Russell
and afterwards Lord Chief Justice of England&mdash;who
had long been at the head of the English
Bar of his own time, proved himself the equal of
any advocate of any time.  Yet he must divide
the honours of that trial with Sir George Lewis.
The profession, or the two professions of barrister
and solicitor, divided them if the public did not.
The public has almost never the means of judging.
The work of preparing a great cause is carried on
in the solicitor's office.  The barrister takes it up
ready made and the way in which he handles his
material is seen of all men.  But no barrister
badly briefed could make much of a complicated
case.  In no trial was this truer than in the Parnell
trial.  Parnell was perhaps the greatest political
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P302"></a>302}</span>
leader of his time, and the least scrupulous.  He
had a black record, and the men behind him a
blacker.  Not even Sir George Lewis could wash it
all white, but without him the judgment would
have gone far more heavily against the Irish
dictator.  And if ever there was a case in which
Lord Russell's eulogy on Sir George Lewis was
to the point it was the Parnell case.  It needed all
his courage in handling facts to save his client
from a condemnation which would have carried
with it his banishment from public life.
Mr. Gladstone marked his sense of the service done
by making Mr. George Lewis Sir George Lewis.
The knighthood some years later became a baronetcy,
the late King, I believe, suggesting it.
</p>

<p>
For the late King, while Prince of Wales, had
stood to the great solicitor in the relation of client,
and this business connection had become one of
friendship.  They were much together at Homburg,
where both spent three or four weeks each
year for many years.  Homburg is a place where
the houses are of glass and everything is known.
The Prince gave his dinners at Ritter's or at the
Kursaal in the open air.  If he went afterward to
play whist&mdash;for these were ante-bridge days&mdash;at
Mr. Lewis's rooms, that was known.  Nor is
publicity, so far as Prince and King are concerned,
much less in England, and when Mr. Lewis dined
at Marlborough House, or was present at a levee
at St. James's Palace, or was a guest at Sandringham,
all these things were of common knowledge.
And since the English are a very loyal people, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P303"></a>303}</span>
had a strong personal attachment to their late
King, the confidence and liking the King showed
him won for Sir George the confidence and liking
of others.
</p>

<p>
This great and eventful career has lasted more
than fifty years, and with the end of 1909 Sir
George Lewis, being seventy-six years old, retired
from business, leaving his son, Mr. George Lewis,
and his other partner, Mr. Reginald Poole, both for
many years his associates, to be his successors.
Both are widely known as learned and skilful in
the law; both have been trained in Sir George's
methods; and the new firm is still, like the old,
known as Lewis &amp; Lewis, and they are still of Ely
Place, Holborn.
</p>

<p>
It is characteristic of old days and ways in
London that Sir George Lewis was born in one of the
three houses now occupied by the firm.  His
father was a solicitor before him; a man of repute
and ability, yet none the less is this vast business
the creation of the son.  There are in London many
firms of solicitors known the world over; the
Messrs. Freshfield, for example, solicitors to the Bank of
England.  But there is seldom or never a fame
due to one man.  It is due to combined action, to
organization, to concentration upon one kind of
business.  The firm of Lewis &amp; Lewis knew no
limitations.  The public thought of Sir George
Lewis as the man to whom the conduct of great
causes was habitually entrusted; sometimes criminal,
sometimes social, often divorce cases, often
those causes in which the honour of a great name
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P304"></a>304}</span>
or a great family is involved.  True, but the
business of Messrs. Lewis &amp; Lewis was first of all
a great commercial business.  Sir George's
permanent clients were among the city firms famous
in finance, or in banking or in industry.  That
was the backbone of the business and continues
to be.
</p>

<p>
The first case in which Mr. Lewis made himself
known to the public arose out of the failure of
Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., then one of the leading
houses in the City of London.  He fought that
case single-handed against barristers of renown;
a bold thing for a solicitor to do, and perhaps
without precedent.  He did the same thing in the
Bravo murder case, and held his own, and more
than his own, against Attorney-General and
Solicitor-General.  No doubt, had he chosen, he
might have gone to the Bar and become distinguished
at the Bar, but not so had he chosen to
model his life.  He never could have played the
part he has, had he done that.  For the dividing
line between solicitor and barrister in England is
just as clearly drawn as ever.  You may be one
or the other; you cannot be both; you may pass
from one to the other, but you must elect between
the two.
</p>

<p>
I ask myself sometimes what London society
would be to-day had there been no Sir George
Lewis.  It certainly would not be what it is.
There have been many, many <i>causes célèbres</i> in
which his name has figured in open court, or in
the still more open newspapers.  But they are as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P305"></a>305}</span>
one to a hundred of those which have never been
tried, and never supplied material for legal
proceedings or for printed scandal.  The simple truth
is that Sir George Lewis, though the most successful
of solicitors in contested causes, has made
fame and fortune by keeping cases out of court
and out of print.  He carried the art of compromise
to its highest point.  He saw that alike in
the interests of his clients and of the public, and
in his own interest also, the greatest service he
could do was to prevent litigation.  On that he
has acted consistently for fifty years.
</p>

<p>
Of how many lawyers can anything like that
be said?  Sir George Lewis stands alone.  The
money results of his policy are splendid.  His
renown is splendid.  But the misery he has soothed
and the social disruptions and disturbances and
far-reaching disasters he has prevented are a
tribute more splendid still.  And perhaps never has
the value of his advice been so evident as when it
has been rejected.
</p>

<p>
In the matter which shook London society
perhaps more than any other of recent years, Sir
George Lewis on one side, and a brilliant young
solicitor, Mr. Charles Russell, son of the late Lord
Chief Justice, on the other, had come to an agreement.
The instrument they had drawn jointly
was ready for signature.  So quietly had all this
distressing business been transacted that, had the
instrument been signed then and there, the world
would never have heard there had been a disagreement
till it learned there had been a settlement.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P306"></a>306}</span>
But outside influences intervened.  One of the
two signatures was withheld.  Then scandal broke
loose and the sewers of London overflowed all
winter.  There were reproaches, recriminations,
divisions; all London taking one side or the other.
Then in the spring the same instrument, word for
word, was signed.  The solicitors had never
wavered nor perhaps ever doubted that since they
were agreed their clients must ultimately agree.
It is a typical example of Sir George Lewis's
methods.  But the mischief that had been done
by intruders could not be undone.
</p>

<p>
Sleeping for half a century, or for only years and
months, in the black japanned tin boxes which
line the walls in Ely Place and in his safes were
papers enough to compromise half London and
scandalize the other half.  Sir George, reflecting
some years ago on this state of things, looked
through the collection and then burnt the whole.
That is the best possible answer to the foolish
story that he intended writing his memoirs.
His sense of professional etiquette and his sense
of honour may both be judged in the light of these
flaming documents.  It had been necessary, of
course, to preserve some of these papers for a
time, on the chance of their being needed again.
But think of the relief with which hundreds and
hundreds of people heard of the burning!  It is
almost as if the tragedies of which all record was
thus destroyed had never happened.[<a id="chap32fn1text"></a><a href="#chap32fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap32fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap32fn1text">1</a>] I have since asked Sir George himself
about this conflagration
story.  He answered: "Yes, it is true,
but there are things
here"&mdash;touching his forehead&mdash;"which
I can neither burn nor forget."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P307"></a>307}</span>
</p>

<p>
Sir George Lewis could coerce as well as coax.
He could use threats, but never a threat he was
not ready to fulfil.  By and by his character
came to be so well understood that a letter from
Ely Place became almost a summons to surrender.
But always on reasonable terms.  With all that,
he had a kindness of heart to which thousands of
people can testify.  I suppose no lawyer ever did
so much for clients without fee or reward.  If you
were his friend, if you were of a profession, if you
came to him with a letter from some friend, if
you came to him in poverty with a case of oppression,
he would take infinite pains for you and no
fee.  He had all sorts of out-of-the-way knowledge;
copyright law, for one, on which he was an authority,
and in which few solicitors are authorities.
There is this link between copyright in books and
in plays and theatrical contracts; the contract is
commonly drawn by the publisher or manager,
who is a man of business; and the author or
actor, who is not, is expected to accept it.  It
was this solicitor's pleasure to redress that balance.
</p>

<p>
He was a law reformer.  Again unlike most
successful men who are apt to be content with
things as they are.  The letters he wrote to <i>The
Times</i> on such matters as the creation of a Court
of Criminal Appeal, alteration in the law of
divorce, the administration of Justice, and other
high legal questions show him a great scientific
lawyer, with a mastery of principles.  He has
essentially a legal mind, and he wrote with a
luminous precision and force not always characteristic
of the legal mind.  And he had what every
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P308"></a>308}</span>
judge on the bench ought to have, and a few of
the greatest really have, an unerring perception
of such facts as are essential, and a power of
dismissing all the rest.  Sir George Jessel had that;
one of the greatest judges.  Students of ethnology
may remark with interest that both were Jews.
When such a man quits the stage it is an irreparable
loss to his friends, to his clients, and to the
world generally.  The feeling is more than regret,
for ties are broken which never existed before
and will never exist again.  Sir George Lewis's
position was unique because his personality is
unique.  So will his fame be.  Reputation in the
law is for the most part transitory.  But this
will endure.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII
<br /><br />
MR. MILLS&mdash;A PERSONAL APPRECIATION AND A FEW ANECDOTES
</h3>

<p>
I recross the Atlantic for a moment.  There
died lately in California a man known on both
sides of the ocean, known in more worlds than
two, one of the strongest and certainly one of the
most amiable figures in the world of business,
Mr. Darius Ogden Mills.
</p>

<p>
Of late years, since Mr. Reid has been Ambassador,
Mr. Mills had become a figure in London.
He interested Englishmen because he was a new
type, or, rather, because he was individual;
because he was Mr. Mills.  Type implies a plurality;
and not only was there but one Mills, there was
none other to whom you could compare him.
Englishmen have formed a notion of their own
about Americans of the class to which, in respect
of his wealth, Mr. Mills belonged; and a high
notion.  They have seen much, for example, of
Mr. Pierpont Morgan, and they seemed inclined
to suppose all great financiers to be, in manner
as in fact, masterful, dominating, huge in physique,
born rulers of other men.  They had never seen
much, if anything, of Mr. Harriman, who hid
away his great qualities beneath a personality
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P310"></a>310}</span>
almost insignificant in appearance save for the
ample head and burning eyes.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Mills was perceived to be like neither of
these, nor like any third.  He was much more
like an Oxford professor; like the late Rev. Mark
Pattison, rector of Lincoln, the Casaubon of
George Eliot's novel.  Mr. Mills had the gentleness,
the refinement, the distinction of the scholar.
It must have been born with him.  He went to no
college.  He had little college learning.  He had
lived in rough times and among rough men; had
twice crossed the continent on foot and in the
saddle, with a cloud of Red Indians ever on the
horizon, and had lived in San Francisco during
those stormy years when Bret Harte's heroes,
gamblers, and ruffians set up their turbulent rule.
But there was a light in Mr. Mills's pale blue eyes
which kept those gentlemen at a distance.  This
delicately-featured face ended in a jaw which was
an index of a character not to be trifled with.
</p>

<p>
Upon all this London remarked with some
surprise, and then with great respect and liking.
They liked his simplicity of manner as much as
his sagacity of speech, and his silence almost as
much as his conversation.  An American who was
an American to the finger-tips but never waved
the flag; a man of affairs who seemed in the world
only a man of the world; a millionaire in whose
pockets the jingle of the dollar was never heard;
such was the rare picture Mr. Mills presented.
He won their sympathies because he never tried
to.  These islanders like a man who is just
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P311"></a>311}</span>
himself, yet is absolutely free from self-assertion.
They gave him first their respect, then their
regard, and finally their affection.
</p>

<p>
I have seen all these feelings shown in the
Metropolitan Club in New York in an unusual way.
Mr. Mills used to come into the card-room of an
afternoon.  There would be two or three or more
rubbers of bridge going on.  Bridge is a passion,
but men would stop in the middle of a rubber and
ask Mr. Mills if he would not take a hand or make
up a new rubber.  Bridge being not only a passion
but the selfish game it is&mdash;necessarily so, like
business&mdash;the tribute was a remarkable one.  If he
declined, somebody would remember suddenly he
had an engagement and beg Mr. Mills as a favour
to take his place.  As he moved about in the club
men rose and walked across the room to greet him,
a thing less rare in New York but unknown in
London, where a club has been defined as a place
in which a man may cut his best friend and no
offence taken.  The general ceremoniousness of
club life in New York would close all the
clubhouses in London.  So would the despotism of
New York club committees.
</p>

<p>
Men listened to him or waited for him to speak
in a way which suggested not only a desire for
an opinion but an attachment to the man.  He
himself was one of the best listeners ever known.
When he spoke it was briefly.  He could say what
he wanted to in a sentence or a few sentences.
In this he was like another and a greater Oxford
Don&mdash;I suppose the greatest of his time&mdash;Jowett,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P312"></a>312}</span>
the Master of Balliol.  Both sat long silent while
others were talking and both seemed to use, and
Jowett certainly did use, the interval in fashioning
his thoughts into epigrams.  Jowett's epigrams
often stung, and were meant to sting, for he
thought presumption and ignorance ought to
be punished.  Perhaps Mr. Mills did but he did
not think he had been appointed to punish them.
</p>

<p>
A group of men in the club were one day
discussing great fortunes and the men who owned
them.  Everybody thought and spoke in millions
and tens of millions.  Finally some one appealed
to the only silent man in the company.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say, Mr. Mills?"
</p>

<p>
"I say that in all these cases, or almost all, I
think it safe to divide the figures by two."
</p>

<p>
"In your own case also?"
</p>

<p>
"Above all in my case."
</p>

<p>
We travelled up together once by the night
express to the Adirondacks on a visit to Mr. Reid's
camp, arriving at the station at six in the morning;
then driving to the lake; then in a boat to the camp,
which could not be reached otherwise.  After his
long night journey he was fresh and alert and not
the least tired, and he talked freely.  He even
discussed business, and presently remarked:
</p>

<p>
"I have been a little anxious about money
matters and was not sure I could get away
from New York."
</p>

<p>
"But why?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but my bank balances are much larger than I
like them to be."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P313"></a>313}</span>
</p>

<p>
I made the obvious and rather foolish answer
that there were plenty of people who would be
willing to relieve him from this anxiety, to which
he retorted:
</p>

<p>
"You know nothing about it.  I am not speaking
of myself.  But a man in my position has his
duties as trustee for others to consider.  Whether
I get three per cent or four per cent for my money
may not much matter, though I prefer five, but to
many of those for whom I act it does matter, and
to them I am under an obligation I must fulfil.  No
man who is not or has not been in business can
have any notion of the ramifications and
complications of business.  But it's worth your while
to consider that."
</p>

<p>
It was the longest speech I had ever heard him
make, and the didactic touch at the end was equally
new.  It was not his way to lecture people.  He
held strong, considered opinions on many subjects,
but thought it no part of his duty to impress
them on the world, though his sure judgment was
at the service of his friends.  His fame and wealth
and position had come to him from what he had
done, not by sermonizing or rhetoric.  Men trusted
him.  There was perhaps no man more generally
trusted.  It is nothing to say he never betrayed a
trust.  He discharged it to the utmost measure of
his ability.  The money which others had put
into his hands had to earn as much as money could
earn.  Three per cent on deposits would seem to
an Englishman affluence, but Mr. Mills appeared
to think he was unfair to his clients to be content,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P314"></a>314}</span>
even temporarily, with three when it could be
invested to earn more.
</p>

<p>
At the camp he talked more freely than elsewhere.
The air was tonic; the life suited him.
In the Adirondacks you do get back into closer
relations with Nature and on more intimate
terms with the great natural forces about you.
This is true in spite of the luxurious simplicity of
the camps.  But Mr. Mills was always happy
where his daughter was.  I may not dwell on
such a matter but her devotion to him was the
light of his life.  He came to London to be with
her.  She returned to America to be with him.  If
his duties and responsibilities had permitted, his
visits here would have been longer and more frequent.
</p>

<p>
Once while I was sitting with him in his office in
Broad Street his lawyer came in with a contract
for him to sign.  Mr. Mills hardly glanced at it, took
up his pen to sign, stopped, and said to the lawyer:
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it is all right?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, Mr. Mills.  I think you will find your
interests protected in every way."
</p>

<p>
"That is not what I mean.  I want to know
whether you have drawn this agreement so as to
leave Mr. A a profit large enough to ensure his
doing his best.  He must have his fair share."
</p>

<p>
A business view, perhaps, and for aught I know
common in the business world, but I had never
happened to hear it put quite like that, nor have
I since.
</p>

<p>
With that may be compared another saying.
A little company, all men of business but me, were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P315"></a>315}</span>
discussing business methods.  One or two of them
stated rather crudely what are sometimes called
the methods of Wall Street.  "There is no sentiment
in business," said one.  "A man who thinks
of others' interests will soon have none of his own
to consider," remarked a second.  And a third,
whose career was strewn with wrecks, declared:
"Of course you have to crush those who stand in
your way."  Said Mr. Mills:
</p>

<p>
"I have done pretty well in business but I
never crushed anybody."
</p>

<p>
The Mills hotels were an expression of his
sentiment toward the society amid which he lived; to
the environment which had given him his later
opportunities.  He wanted to enlarge the opportunities
of other men, to sweeten their lives a little,
to enable them to do more for themselves.  His
scheme was derided and was a success from the
start, and the success has grown greater ever since.
The success was due to the patience with which
he thought out his plans.  The afternoon before I
sailed from New York, in 1906, I met Mr. Mills in
his victoria at the door of the Metropolitan Club.
"Come for a drive in the park," he said, and we
went.  He began at once to talk about his new
hotel.  We drove for two hours and during nearly
all that time he discussed plans, estimates, details,
methods of economical working, organization, the
effect on the tenants, and a hundred other matters
relating to the building, equipment, and operation
of the hotel soon to be erected.
</p>

<p>
He had all the facts and figures in his mind.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P316"></a>316}</span>
talked with an enthusiasm he rarely showed.  His
heart was in it.
</p>

<p>
To the last his energies seemed inexhaustible;
and his interests.  He arrived one afternoon at
Dorchester House at five o'clock from New York.
There was a large dinner at 8.30, then a ball which
he did not leave till toward one in the morning.
I met him again at tea next day and he told me he
had been at the White City since nine that
morning, and when I suggested that he had gone about
that marvellous but very fatiguing show in a
chair, he said: "Oh, no, on my legs."  Nor did he
seem tired nor mind the prospect of another large
dinner that night.  He was then eighty-two years
old.  Pneumonia had attacked him winter after
winter, but he always rallied and would take no
better care of himself than before.
</p>

<p>
In that slight, erect figure Nature had packed
powers of endurance which bigger frames had not.
Everything was reduced to its essence.  There was
nothing superfluous and nothing wanting.  The
features were sculptured.  It was the face of a
man who had a real distinction of nature; who
had benignity and judgment and acute perceptions
all in equal measure.  They bore the stamp of an
impregnable integrity, as his life did.  Unlike
qualities in him melted into harmony and a rounded
whole.  For with his unyielding firmness and
strength and uncompromising convictions and
invincible sense of justice went a loving kindness
which made him the most lovable of men.  That
was Mr. Mills.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV
<br /><br />
LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL&mdash;BEING MOSTLY PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
I venture on an anecdote or two, which I have
told elsewhere but imperfectly, those whom it
concerns being now dead or retired.  They were
three; Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Randolph Churchill,
and Mr. Archibald Forbes; all at that moment in
the splendour, the blinding splendour, of their
gifts and powers.  It was after luncheon.  The
ladies had gone.  Lord Randolph had been
Secretary of State for India, and Forbes, like Lord
Randolph, had lately been in India, and the talk
turned upon India.  All three were men who
spoke their minds; not at all an uncommon practice
in this country, where men dissent freely, and even
bluntly, from the expressed opinion of others, and
no offence taken.  Lord Randolph and Forbes
differed sharply.  Neither stood in awe of the
other, or of any man.  Forbes would make a
statement.  Lord Randolph would answer:
</p>

<p>
"I know you have been in India but from what
you say I shouldn't suppose you knew where it
was."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P318"></a>318}</span>
</p>

<p>
Lord Randolph would go on to point out what
he thought Forbes's mistakes; then Forbes:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you have ruled India but the real India is
a sealed book to you."
</p>

<p>
And so on.  Presently they discussed the Indian
Civil Service and Mr. Chamberlain came to the
front.  In the new Civil Service lay, he thought,
the hope of India.  Appointments were no longer
jobbed.  A new class of men were brought into
the service by examination, well taught, well
trained, competent, and drawn from the whole
people of England.  Lord Randolph listened
impatiently, interrupted now and then, but on the
whole listened.  When Mr. Chamberlain had
finished Lord Randolph burst out:
</p>

<p>
"I have heard that before.  No greater nonsense
was ever talked.  What is the Indian Civil
Service; or rather, what was it?  A boy of twenty
went out as a clerk.  From Calcutta he was sent up
country, nominally in charge of a bureau, really to
govern a district.  He did govern it.  He had
passed no examination.  Very likely he couldn't
tell you the date of the battle of Plassey or the
lineage of a native Prince.  He had no mathematics,
no Latin, and probably couldn't spell.
But he had character.  He knew how to govern
because he came of a governing class.  And he
was a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"Whereas now"&mdash;looking steadily at
Chamberlain&mdash;"instead of gentlemen you get men
from&mdash;Birmingham and God knows where."
</p>

<p>
Chamberlain, who seldom declined any
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P319"></a>319}</span>
contest to which he was invited, sat cool and
smiling while Lord Randolph launched his shafts.
When he had emptied his quiver the member for
Birmingham, still cool and smiling, observed that
he thought it was time for us to join the ladies;
and we did.  Instantly the sky cleared.  India
was forgotten.  The two combatants walked
upstairs arm in arm, and the storm was as if it
had never been.
</p>

<p>
The little scene in which Lord Randolph
Churchill was the chief actor brings that vivid
personality once again vividly to mind.  Indeed, it is
never long absent from the general memory.  He
has left a mark on the public life of this country
which will last as long as anything lasts.  And he
has left a portrait of himself in the memory of all
who really knew him.  Besides which, he has left
a son who does not allow us long to forget his
existence or his relation to the affairs of the moment.
A great authority was quoted quite lately as
saying, "Winston is an abler man even than his
father."  I asked him whether he said it.  "No,
I said cleverer, not abler," which seemed a very
just distinction.
</p>

<p>
I have not really much to add to the account of
Lord Randolph which I wrote in January, 1895,
upon his death.  I adhere to all I then said.  The
estimate seems to me fair, if not complete.  The
years that have passed take nothing from Lord
Randolph's fame.  If anything, they add to it.
And for this reason: his conception of the political
future of his country was a true conception.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P320"></a>320}</span>
To him the year 1884, with its revolutionary
enlargement of the suffrage, was the turning point
of modern English history.  The middle classes
vacated the throne they had occupied since 1832.
The working classes succeeded to their inheritance.
Their power has steadily grown.  They are two-thirds
of the electorate to-day.  They have, it is
true, but 30 out of 670 Members of Parliament,
but these figures are in no respect representative
of their real authority.  They and the Irish
Nationalists hold the balance of power in the
House of Commons.  They returned fewer members
to the House this year than in 1906, but that
was because of an arrangement between them and
the Liberals&mdash;for value received.  And no man
doubts that the power of the Labour Party will
hereafter increase and not decrease.  For the first
time in the history of England they openly proclaim
their purpose to legislate and to influence
legislation in the interest of a single class and not
in the interest of all classes and of the country as a
whole.  Their excuse is that they are a majority.
But the day when a majority takes no account of
the minority, or thinks a minority has no rights
which the majority is bound to respect is a black
day in the history of any country.
</p>

<p>
But this, in substance if not in detail is what Lord
Randolph foresaw and announced; and he was
the only man to foresee it.  He did not disdain, as
Mr. Gladstone did, to look ahead, to form to
himself some conception of what the future of England
was to be with this rising tide of Democracy.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P321"></a>321}</span>
His conception, as I said, was a true conception,
and the political genius of the man was never more
clearly visible than in this forecast, and in the
means he proposed to himself and to his party for
dealing with a situation absolutely new.
</p>

<p>
Lord Randolph's Dartford speech in 1886 will
therefore remain a monument to his sagacity.
It was a speech which may be read to-day with
profit and admiration.  So may that at Birmingham,
of which "Trust the People" is the motto.
I will go farther.  If I wanted a body of political
doctrine to put into the hands of an American
student of English politics I would as soon offer
him Lord Randolph's speeches as any other.  There
is no complete collection but there are the two
volumes edited by Mr. Louis Jennings and published
by Messrs. Longmans in 1889.  They cover
a period of only nine years, 1880-8, but they are
a handbook to the political life of England for a
generation.  Lord Randolph had this rare merit&mdash;rare
in this country&mdash;he dealt habitually with
principles, and his treatment of political questions
was not empirical but scientific.  And he was
absolutely fearless.
</p>

<p>
He was fearless alike in public and private, and
he looked his own fortunes in the face whether they
presented themselves to him with the promise of
good or of ill.  He knew he was a doomed man.  He
cast his own horoscope shortly before he flung that
fatal card upon the table which lost him the game
in his long contest with Lord Salisbury.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"I shall be five years in office or in opposition.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P322"></a>322}</span>
Then I shall be five years Prime Minister.  Then
I shall die."
</p>

<p>
And he was right as to the length of his life
though a perverse fate and his one fatal miscalculation,
"I forgot Goschen," falsified the rest of
his prediction.  Mr. Winston Churchill queries
this saying but I am inclined to think it authentic.
</p>

<p>
Many of these matters I used to hear Lord
Randolph discuss in private, and even now I
suppose they must remain private though the
impression his talks left may fairly be described.
I listened to his views on finance&mdash;long before
he was Finance Minister&mdash;through nearly the
whole of a long summer afternoon.  We were at
Cliveden.  That beautiful possession had not
then passed into Mr. Astor's hands.  It still
belonged to the Duke of Westminster, and had
been lent by him to the Duchess of Marlborough&mdash;widow
of that seventh Duke of Marlborough who
was Viceroy of Ireland&mdash;and Lord Randolph's
mother.  The Duchess was a woman who may
always be adduced in support of the theory that
qualities of mind and character descend from
mother to son.  She was a woman of great natural
shrewdness and force, with an insight into the
true nature of such things as interested her; and
the one thing that interested her above all others
was her second son, Lord Randolph.
</p>

<p>
"Come for a drive after lunch," said Lord
Randolph, and we went in a dog-cart to Burnham
Beeches and Taplow and elsewhere for many
miles and hours through the woods which are one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P323"></a>323}</span>
of the glories of that delightful country.  It was
a perfect afternoon.  You were not the least
disposed to ask with Lowell, "What is so rare as a
day in June?"  Rather:
</p>

<p>
  In the afternoon they came unto a land<br />
  In which it seemed always afternoon.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
And always June.  That is one of the enchantments
of this versatile climate.  When in a good
mood you think it will be always good.  And the
enchantments in and about Cliveden were many
and to-day are many more.
</p>

<p>
To all of them Lord Randolph seemed for the
moment insensible.  His mind was upon Finance,
and upon Finance he discoursed during the better
part of three hours.  To the sunlight and the
flower-strewn hedges and the far-stretching forests
he paid no more attention than he did to his
driving.  The horse took his own pace, and being a
well-trained animal showed a sensible preference
for his own side of the road.
</p>

<p>
Lord Randolph's talk was not much more than
thinking aloud.  His financial opinions which
became afterward, like those of all Chancellors of
the Exchequer, rigid, were in process of formation.
Now and then he asked a question about the
Treasury in America but for the most part his
monologue was a soliloquy.  I know few things
more instructive than to see a mind like his at
work.  He thought as he talked on, but the sentences
fell from his lips clean-cut and finished.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P324"></a>324}</span>
was not announcing conclusions nor laying down
laws.  Finance was then comparatively new to
him.  He would take up any idea or view as it
occurred to him, hold it before him, look at it
from all sides, and either drop it or put it on a
shelf till he could see how it fitted with the next.
I said as he pressed a proposal&mdash;I have forgotten
what:
</p>

<p>
"You break with all tradition."
</p>

<p>
"What do you suppose I am here for?  Have
you ever known me to adopt an opinion because
somebody else had adopted it?"
</p>

<p>
And in truth I had not, nor had any one.  Part
of his charm lay in his independence; and a large
part.  He was fettered by no restrictions nor
overborne by any authority.  Once only, as he told
me at another time, did he find himself "in the
presence of a superior being," Mr. Gladstone, to
wit.  "I could argue, but before the man himself
I bent."  But I have related that story in the
paper referred to above.  Yet we find Lord
Randolph telling Prince Bismarck, who asked him
whether the English people would exchange
Mr. Gladstone for General Caprivi:
</p>

<p>
"The English people would cheerfully give you
Mr. Gladstone for nothing but you would find
him an expensive present."
</p>

<p>
Of Prince Bismarck, however, Lord Randolph
seems not to have received the same impression he
did of Mr. Gladstone, high as is the tribute he
pays him.  There had been a little friction.  In
1888, in Berlin, Prince Bismarck had refused to see
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P325"></a>325}</span>
Lord Randolph, or to meet him at lunch at Count
Herbert's, and he calls the great Chancellor a
<i>grincheux</i> old creature who kept away because
Lord Randolph had used all his influence "to
prevent Lord Salisbury from being towed in his
wake."  But at Kissingen, in 1893&mdash;Lord
Randolph, alas, being no longer in a position to
influence, nor Prince Bismarck, alas, any longer
Chancellor of the Empire he had created&mdash;there
was a meeting.  Lord Randolph wrote an account
of it to his mother, and the letter, a most
picturesque letter, is given in the <i>Life</i>.  Lord Randolph
felt the fascination the Prince could exercise when
he chose, and pays due tribute to him.  But
it is admiration, not awe, he feels in the great
German's presence.  In truth, Lord Randolph
had said savage things of Prince Bismarck in days
past, as well as of Mr. Gladstone.  "If you want
to sup with him you must have a long spoon."
</p>

<p>
The domestic and personal side of Lord Randolph
had a fascination quite other than that of
his political life.  Simplicity was one note of it;
that and the absolute freedom from affectation
which is natural to a man whose courage is equal
to every demand.  I began meaning to be domestic
and personal but I shrink from saying most
of the things I should like to.  Two summers in
succession he had an old Elizabethan house near
Egham, known as Great Forsters; the house still
encompassed by a moat, mostly dry.  I had
always thought him at his best in his own home,
where, whoever might be his guest, he recognized
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P326"></a>326}</span>
his obligations as host, and his manner softened
and the lawlessness of his tongue was restrained.
</p>

<p>
This impression grew stronger with these visits.
It happened that two of their guests, his and
Lady Randolph's, were attractive to both of them
as well as to the rest of the world.  The two were
the beautiful Duchess of Leinster and Sir Henry
Drummond Wolff.  The Duchess of Leinster was
at that time in the full splendour of her loveliness.
I had never seen her except at a ball or dinner or
on some other social occasion, in the glory of a
toilet and of her shoulders and diamonds, when
she was perhaps the most resplendent object to
be seen in London.  At Great Forsters she went
about during the day in the simplest of gowns.
She was less dazzling but not less charming.  As
for Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, he and Lord
Randolph set each other off.  Their intimacy was
both political and personal.  If I may use such
a word of two men, I should say they were on
affectionate terms.  Both of them were capable
of cynicism but that only made their affection
the more striking.  There were no ties of blood
but as you looked on this little group and listened
to their talk, which was both easy and brilliant,
you felt as if you were present at a family gathering.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
Lord Randolph Churchill despised two things
which (I am told) are much respected in the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P327"></a>327}</span>
United States; public opinion and money.  Of
course, in public life he had to take account of
public opinion and he was a very good judge of it,
and in 1886 he taught his party to take account
of it.  But what I mean is that, while he admitted
and asserted the necessity of calculating forces
as the first business of a statesman, he was never
subservient to that majority which he sought to
make his own.  He was not frightened by names
and he did not shrink from unpopularity.  He
told Prince Bismarck at Kissingen that nobody
in England cared a rap what the papers said,
which meant that he (Lord Randolph) did not
care a rap.  Yet at opportune moments he used
the Press with skill.  Or, if I ought not to say
used, he availed himself adroitly of the Press to
serve his own purpose.  His midnight journey to
<i>The Times</i> office in Printing House Square in order
to tell Mr. Buckle that he had resigned from Lord
Salisbury's Ministry and that his resignation had
been accepted is a case in point.  It is just
conceivable that Mr. Buckle took, or might have
taken, a more lenient view of Lord Randolph's
<i>coup de tête</i> from having the exclusive news of it.
It is, at any rate, conceivable that the resigning
Minister imagined, or hoped, a friendly opinion
would be expressed.
</p>

<p>
I will give a very different instance which came
to my knowledge directly.  At the time of the
great dock strike which disordered and threatened
to destroy all the waterside industries of the port
of London, Cardinal Manning sided with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P328"></a>328}</span>
strikers.  He was a prelate who often mixed
politics with his religion or, to put it more
charitably, with his ecclesiastical polity.  He went to
the East End and made a speech at the strikers'
meeting, undeterred by the fact that they were
threatening violence, and he wound up by giving
£25 to the cause of these enemies of public order.
</p>

<p>
All this came out in next morning's papers.
Toward noon I went to see Lord Randolph.  He
was full of the subject and his sympathies with
the men were evident.  He had read Cardinal
Manning's speech and, with certain reservations,
approved of it.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he ought to have given money
to encourage disorder?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by encouraging disorder?
The men are out of work.  They and their wives
are starving.  I would gladly give £25 myself if
I had it."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I suppose no act of Cardinal
Manning, nothing he did in his extremely
variegated career, brought upon him more or better
deserved censure in the Press than the countenance
he gave to this very dangerous industrial
rebellion.  The censure upon Lord Randolph would
surely have been not less severe.  But what
cared he?  Lord Randolph, I ought to add, had
been during a great part of his too short political
life the friend and champion of the working men.
He believed them to be the necessary support of
the Conservative Party without which, as the
event proved, that party could win no great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P329"></a>329}</span>
victory at the polls.  He believed them to be,
as a body, like the majority of the English people,
irrespective of party, essentially Conservative.
He was ready to do what he could to lighten and
brighten their sometimes dreary lot.  It was not
only as a politician that he interested himself
in their fortunes.  He had a man's sympathy
with other men less fortunate than himself.
</p>

<p>
Less fortunate, but perhaps not always much
less.  For what I said above about Lord
Randolph's indifference to money was true during
nearly all his life, and was shown in many ways
to his own hurt.  He had the usual younger son's
portion, and in this country of magnificent estates
the younger son's portion is of the most modest
description.  Not otherwise than by reserving
the great bulk of the family wealth to eldest sons,
one after the other, can these magnificent estates
be kept together and kept magnificent.  But Lord
Randolph's tastes and ambitions were nowise in
proportion to the slenderness of his income.  The
present Mr. Winston Churchill in his most
admirable <i>Life</i> of his father has made some reference
to two occasions in which questions of money
became critical.  He has said so much that I
think I may say a little more.
</p>

<p>
The first was in anticipation of his marriage.
Mr. Jerome had the ideas of the average American
father about settlements.  Lord Randolph's ideas
on that subject were English.  There was a
collision between the two.  The wooer had already
announced to his father, the seventh Duke of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P330"></a>330}</span>
Marlborough, his attachment to Miss Jerome
and the Duke had agreed provisionally to the
engagement.  Mr. Jerome had agreed, but his
views about money threatened to break off the
negotiations.  At the end&mdash;they had lasted seven
months&mdash;Lord Randolph "refused utterly to agree
to any settlement which contained even technical
provisions to which he objected."  He delivered
to Mr. Jerome what his biographer rightly calls
an ultimatum.  He was "ready to earn a living in
England or out of it" without Mr. Jerome's help,
and in this the girl agreed with him.  Mr. Jerome
capitulated.  Perhaps the difference between them
was more a matter of form than anything.  The
terms of the final agreement are not stated in the
<i>Life</i>.  They have often been stated in London
where everything on every subject of human interest
is known, and where it was always understood
that Mr. Jerome agreed to settle £2000 a year
on his daughter and son-in-law, with remainder
to the children, duly secured by a mortage on the
University Club house in Madison Square.  But
what I ask you to notice is the readiness of Lord
Randolph to fling away an income far larger than
he had ever had unless it came to him on such
terms as he thought right and unless his English
views were accepted by this American father.
</p>

<p>
The other instance relates to South Africa.
When he went to Mashonaland, in 1891, he
borrowed £5000 from a good and staunch friend
whom I should like to name&mdash;well, why should I
not?  I mean Lord Rothschild, whose kindnesses
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P331"></a>331}</span>
to men of every degree and of all religions and
races have been innumerable.  If ever a great
fortune paid, in the long-ago phrase of Mr. Chamberlain,
a ransom, his has paid it; not compulsory
but from true good-will to men.  Lord Randolph
invested the £5000 in Rand gold mining shares
on the advice of that American engineer of genius,
Mr. Perkins, who inferred from the dip of the
gold-bearing reefs the direction and depth at
which they could be overtaken by shafts sunk
far south of the actual gold area.  The world
knows the result and is the richer by hundreds
of millions for the vision which pierced the outer
crest of the earth and saw the treasures hidden
below.  Mr. Perkins was, in fact, the engineer
whom Lord Rothschild had sent to South Africa
with Lord Randolph.  They had gone through
Mashonaland together vainly, and the ex-Chancellor
of the Exchequer now invested his £5000
in Rand shares.  But values of that nature require
time and being in want of money he sold
two-fifths of his investment.  The remainder he held
till his death when it was disposed of for something
over £70,000.  A comfortable fortune to leave?
Yes, comfortable enough to pay the debts of the
estate.  That was one form which his contempt
for money took.  He lived on the principal.  It
is no matter of censure.  He was born and built
that way.  The strain of frugality in the first
Duke of Marlborough had worn itself out.
</p>

<p>
My last meeting with Lord Randolph was at
Tring, Lord Rothschild's place in Buckinghamshire.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P332"></a>332}</span>
He was already in the grip of the illness
which was to destroy him; nervous, irritable,
restless in manner, haggard to look at, and his speech
uncertain.  I don't like to think of it and I
mention it only for the sake of the contrast.  For now
and again the old brilliancy reappeared, and the
old charm.  He had both in a measure given to
few men.  Wilful as he was, with a freedom of
speech which overpassed the usual social limits,
he had also when he chose the graces and gifts
which made him beloved of men and of women.
No man made more enemies; but in this world&mdash;by
which I mean this world of England and other
worlds where the English people have built new
civilizations&mdash;it is not enmities which count but
friendships.
</p>

<p>
Whether you saw him in the House of Commons,
leading it as no man had ever led it, or at a
dinner, or on the platform, or, if you like, on the
Turf or in other places which the Puritan thinks
of the devil, he had the same ascendancy.  He
said once to Lord Rosebery that to both of them
their titles had been helpful in public life.  No
doubt, but something besides a title descends or
may descend, to him who bears it.  Not every
son of a duke has upon him the stamp of the
patrician.  That is what Lord Randolph had.  An
imperious temper, an intellectual disdain of
natures from which intellects had been omitted,
moods of black despair late in life, but all through
life the set resolve to win his battles without much
thought of the cost&mdash;all these he had, and no one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P333"></a>333}</span>
of them nor all of them broke or impaired the spell
he laid upon those about him.
</p>

<p>
Narrow means never stinted his generosity.
Uncertain health never stilled his passion for work.
I never went into his library that I did not find
him busy.  I have seen him at dinner turn away
from the distinguished woman who passed for the
most amusing of talkers to devote himself to a
neglected stranger.  When he quarrelled with the
Prince of Wales (King Edward) and went into a
kind of social exile for seven years, while he was
quite aware of the price he was paying, he never
dreamed of surrender.  When Lord Salisbury, not
choosing to remember or perhaps not able to
remember his services and his capacities, passed
him over in 1891 for the last time, and gave the
leadership of the House of Commons to his nephew,
Mr. Balfour, he writes to his wife: "All confirms
me in my decision to have done with politics and
try to make a little money for the boys and for
ourselves."  On his release from party obligations
he sought others, and his sister, Lady Tweedmouth,
between whom and himself there was on both
sides a devoted attachment, persuaded him to
see something of men from whom he had held aloof.
Mr. Gladstone was among these, and I end with
Mr. Gladstone's remark about Lord Randolph:
</p>

<p>
"He was the courtliest man I ever met."

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV
<br /><br />
LORD GLENESK AND "THE MORNING POST"
</h3>

<p>
The owning or leasing of several houses is an
English habit which is no longer confined
to great landowners who have inherited their
possessions.  Many men whose success in life
is their own adopt the custom.  Among many
instances I will take one, for other reasons than
house-owning, the late Lord Glenesk, who had
at one time a lease of Invercauld, the fine place
belonging to the Farquharson family.  There, as
later at Glenmuich, he liked to gather friends
about him and there was each year a succession
of parties.  In the beginning Mr. Borthwick, he
became successively Sir Algernon Borthwick and
Lord Glenesk.  His name and his wife's connect
themselves with many social memories in Scotland,
in London, where the house in Piccadilly was
long a brilliant centre, and in Cannes where they
occupied in winter the Chateau St. Michel at the
Californie end of the town in beautiful grounds
touching on the sea.  They had also for some
years that square red brick house in Hampstead
on the edge of the heath, with a little land and a
brick wall about it, and there they entertained of
a Sunday during part of the season.  Both had the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P335"></a>335}</span>
art of hospitality and the secret of social life,
by which I mean the secret of translating mere
hospitality into happiness for others.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Borthwick acquired <i>The Morning Post</i> in
1876.  It was then a threepenny paper&mdash;six cents
on each of six days of the week.  No Englishman
had ever then thought of a Sunday edition of a
daily paper; nor has since.  There are Sunday
papers in London, of which one, <i>The Observer</i>, is a
supremely able journal, but they are published
one and all on Sundays only.  When <i>The Morning
Post</i> passed into the hands of its late proprietor
the penny paper had already made its appearance,
though not the halfpenny.  The future, it was
thought, belonged to the penny, but <i>The Morning
Post</i> like <i>The Times</i> was supposed to appeal to a
special class.  It was the organ of the fashionable
world.  You went to it for all that fashionable
intelligence now supplied, more or less completely
by all papers.  It was the one newspaper which
lay on the table of every drawing-room in
Mayfair and Belgravia and in every country house
throughout the kingdom.  Till Borthwick became
editor it was respectable, decorous, conventional,
and dull.  It had little news except what came
to it through Reuter and other news agencies.
There were flashes of vivacity when young
Borthwick went to Paris, a city he understood, and
sent home sparkling letters which were the most
readable things in the paper and always seemed
a little out of place.  It was an organ of
Conservatism, but the kind of Conservatism expounded
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P336"></a>336}</span>
in its editorial columns was more orthodox than
inspiring.  It had a moderate circulation and its
net yearly profits were not far from thirty
thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Borthwick came into control of this
property&mdash;not at first, but not very long after&mdash;he
conceived the notion of turning it into a penny
paper.  It was he who told me the story.  He had
originality and he had courage but he was also
a man who sought advice in great enterprises
and he talked this scheme over with many men of
experience far greater than his own.  He said to
me later:
</p>

<p>
"One and all they advised me against it.  One
and all they thought it spelled ruin; or, if not ruin,
a great risk to a valuable though not great
property and the certainty of loss.  They told me I
should inevitably forfeit the support of the classes
to whom <i>The Post</i> had always appealed and that I
should not gain new subscribers from other classes
in numbers sufficient to make good these losses.
I should lose not only readers but advertisers, for
the advertisers in <i>The Post</i> were largely the West
End tradespeople who desired to reach their West
End patrons.  I should lose the political authority
which was based on the support of the privileged
classes.  In short, a penny <i>Morning Post</i>
was inconceivable and unthinkable from any
point of view whatever."
</p>

<p>
To all of which Borthwick listened.  He considered
every argument and objection and protest
laid before him.  But he was one of those men who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P337"></a>337}</span>
regarded the opinions of other men not as authoritative
but as the material for forming his own
opinion, and he summed the whole story up in a
sentence:
</p>

<p>
"Every journalist and every man of business
whom I consulted was opposed to the change and
I finally took my decision to make <i>The Morning
Post</i> a penny paper in the face of a unanimous
remonstrance by friends and experts of all kinds."
</p>

<p>
When Borthwick told me this some years had
passed since the change had been made.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"In the first year the profits of the paper
doubled.  In the second they reached £20,000.
By the fifth the amount was £30,000."
</p>

<p>
And so it went on until the annual net income
of <i>The Morning Post</i> was £60,000&mdash;ten times what
it had been at the price of threepence.  It continued
to be the organ of the classes; not, however,
refusing to accept that Tory Democracy of which
Lord Randolph Churchill was the inventor, upon
which Toryism, Conservatism, and Unionism have
ever since thriven.  Neither Mayfair nor
Belgravia nor the country houses ever tried to do
without it.  The advertisers continued to advertise.
It became, moreover, the organ of the better class
of servants; butlers, ladies' maids, footmen, and
the multitude of menials who sought places in
the best houses.
</p>

<p>
In other respects also the paper was
revolutionized.  It became a newspaper.  The day of
the humdrum was over.  It had special news
services and capable men to conduct them.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P338"></a>338}</span>
Borthwick was a patient man impatient of dulness.
He gathered about him good journalists and good
writers; not always the same thing.  You now
began to read the news and letters and leaders
from some other motive than a sense of duty.
They were readable.  The hand of the master
left its mark on every column.
</p>

<p>
Nor did the demands of journalism exhaust Sir
Algernon Borthwick's energies.  He went into
politics and into Parliament, sitting for a vast
constituency in South Kensington.  Lady Borthwick's
help in this political and election business
was invaluable.  That very accomplished lady
brought to bear upon the voters of South Kensington
a kind of influence to which they had been
unaccustomed, a social influence.  Their wives
took part in the game, neither having nor desiring
votes but able to affect the course of events as
much as if the ballot had been theirs, and more.
Lady Borthwick had 2500 names on her visiting
list, and they were more than names.  Each name
stood for an individual whom Lady Borthwick
knew, and whose value she knew.  The beautiful
white drawing-room at No. 139 Piccadilly was in
those days a little more thronged of an afternoon
or evening than it had been, but was never
crowded.  Some of the best music in London was
to be heard there at tea-time.  The dinners were
carefully studied.  Dances and evening parties
had a slightly political flavour but were none
the less successful.  There is, I suppose, no
place where more than in London their gentle
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P339"></a>339}</span>
influences have a more soothing effect upon an
electorate.
</p>

<p>
If any reader reflects on the true nature of the
exploit which Borthwick accomplished he will
perhaps agree that the man capable of it must have
had a high order of genius.  If it was not creative
in the sense that Lord Northcliffe's is creative, it
was perfectly adapted to the circumstances and the
time.  It has not perhaps been quite adequately
recognized.  Lord Glenesk was so much a figure
in society that when his name was mentioned
men who knew only the surface of things saw
in him the ornament of a ballroom.  He was
that, and he was so very much more that this
ballroom part of his life is hardly even incidental.
He would dance night after night.  In the day-time
his mind applied itself to some of the stiffest
problems of a very difficult profession.  He told
me one morning he had not been in bed for three
nights.  The only answer I could make was that
I did not know he ever went to bed.  But I knew
that after sleepless nights he spent days of
necessary hard work at the office, and that he brought
to each matter he dealt with the freshness of a
fresh mind.  It was late in life before he began to
know the meaning of the word tired.
</p>

<p>
Take him for all in all, I should name Lord
Glenesk as one of the three great men I have
known in English journalism.  And whether in or
out of journalism he had a kindliness, a charm, a
sweet authority in the affairs of life which do not
belong to all successful men.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P340"></a>340}</span>
</p>

<p>
By and by there appeared in Lady Borthwick's
drawing-rooms a fresh flower of a girl whose
presence at her mother's afternoon concerts and
then at evening parties was a little in advance of
her coming out.  Miss Lilias Borthwick is now
the Countess Bathurst and I believe has, when
she chooses to exercise it, full control over <i>The
Morning Post</i>; of which Mr. Fabian Ware is the
present editor, a young journalist who has made
himself a name in his profession.  Lady Bathurst
is, like her mother, one of those women who possess
better means of making their wishes and character
felt than by clamouring for votes.  There are cases
where womanly charm may be the companion of
settled opinions and convictions and clear purposes,
to which <i>The Morning Post</i> of to-day is a
witness.
</p>

<p>
One factor in the success of the paper was Oliver
Borthwick, the son of Lord Glenesk.  Journalism
attracted him; he entered his father's office early;
his aptitudes for the business showed themselves
at once, and before many years he was managing
editor.  He had an inquiring, inventive mind.
He kept his Conservatism for politics, and applied
to the conduct of <i>The Morning Post</i> the most
original and even radical and sometimes daring
methods.  He understood details and thought no
detail beneath the notice of a manager.  He liked
to do things which the old hands in the office
pronounced impossible, among them that paged
index to the contents of the paper which he first
believed and then proved to be practicable.  All
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P341"></a>341}</span>
this did not stand in the way of broad conceptions
and great schemes for which his father gave him a
free hand.  Lord Glenesk asked me one day if
Oliver had told me of his newest plan.  I said no.
"Well, you had better ask him about it.  I shall
not interfere, though it is going to cost a lot of
money"; and he named a sum which ran into many
figures.  Those were the relations which existed
between father and son.  But there came a day
when they existed no longer.  Oliver Borthwick's
joy in his work was such that he never spared
himself and he died at thirty-two, his father still
living.  The only gift he lacked was the gift of
adapting his work to his strength.  He overworked
recklessly; he could not do otherwise.  He would
spare everybody but himself.  And so to-day,
instead of being an ornament of his profession
and of social life, Oliver Borthwick is only a
memory and a lasting regret.
</p>

<p>
Since the foregoing was written Mr. Reginald
Lucas has published his <i>Lord Glenesk and The
Morning Post</i>, an agreeable and informing book.
This is not the place to comment on it but I should
like to add to what I have said above of Lord
Glenesk a passage from a signed review by me
in <i>The Morning Post</i>:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"As I think of the man whom I knew, the importance
of the things he did, great and brilliant
as they were, seems to me less than the importance
of the man himself.  If I could, I should
like to describe not what he did but what he was.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P342"></a>342}</span>
I should say that his friendships, to which I have
already referred, were part not only of his life but
of himself.  The range of them would show that.
Political friendships came to him in his position
as a matter of course.  But friendships non-political
were more numerous and more remarkable still.
The late Queen's regard for him was a strong one.
Early in life he was the friend of that astonishing
Frenchwoman, Elizabeth Rachel Felix, more
commonly known as Rachel, perhaps the greatest
tragedian of all time, in almost the full flower
of her genius at seventeen.  Later in life he was
the friend, the very helpful and trusted friend,
of Madame Sarah Bernhardt.  He early conceived
and retained to the end an affection for the French
Emperor.  I need not go on with the catalogue
but there are many friends, not to be named, who
were under obligations to him for kindnesses and
whom he seems to have liked because he had helped
them.  All through life that was true.  He gave
freely, generously, delicately.  <i>Nihil humani</i> was
his motto or one of his mottoes.  There must have
been many.  A life so varied as his does not
move to the music of a single air on a single
string.
</p>

<p>
"Not the briefest, and not even the most public,
notice of Lord Glenesk can omit all reference to
the happiness of his private life.  Even the few
lines above may show what part his wife had in
his happiness, and he in hers.  Of his daughter,
Lady Bathurst, Mr. Lucas has told us something
with due reserve; enough to give his readers at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P343"></a>343}</span>
least a hint of the affection between her and her
father and why it was on both sides so deep, and is
on hers so abiding.  Oliver was to all the world a
beloved and brilliant figure, and when the time
came his father's right hand; then finally relieving
him of his executive cares.  Then at thirty-two
came the end, and then the father at seventy-five
takes up the burden once more, but not for long.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Lucas tells us that President Roosevelt's
'manner of receiving Oliver was particularly
flattering.'  I hope it may interest his friends if
I enlarge that a little.  Oliver told me when he
came to Washington that he had the usual
introduction from the British Ambassador, which is
indispensable, and asked me what he had better
do.  He wished something more than a formal
interview as one of the many whom it was the
President's habit to receive in line, bestowing
a few cordial but conventional words on each.
I saw the President that afternoon, told him
something of Oliver's position and of Oliver
himself.  He answered, 'Bring him to lunch
to-morrow.'  At lunch the President put him next
to himself and the two talked together during and
after this meal.  Then Oliver and I walked away.
He said, 'The President is a great natural force,'
a phrase which recalls Lord Morley's later remark
that the two greatest natural phenomena he had
seen in the United States were Niagara and
President Roosevelt.  The day following I again saw
the President, who perhaps will for once allow
himself to be quoted.  He said: 'Your friend
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P344"></a>344}</span>
Oliver Borthwick is a very young man, but a
man.'  Then a pause; then, 'And what charm he
has.  It is long since I have met any newcomer
whom I have liked better.'"

CHAPTER XXXVI
<br /><br />
  QUEEN VICTORIA AT BALMORAL&mdash;KING EDWARD AT<br />
  DUNROBIN&mdash;ADMIRAL SIR HEDWORTH LAMBTON&mdash;OTHER<br />
  ANECDOTES<br />
</h3>

<p>
Invercauld, of which Lord Glenesk was
long tenant, lies near Balmoral; a name famous
the world over as the Highland home of Queen
Victoria and then of the late King.  A castle on
which the very German taste of the very German
husband of the great Queen has left its mark.
It is no more a fine castle than Buckingham Palace
is a fine palace.  It stands, however, in a beautiful
country and some of the best drives within easy
reach are those on the Invercauld property.  They
are private but all gates swing open to Kings and
Queens.
</p>

<p>
The privacy was one thing the Queen liked.
So long as she was in the Highlands the loyalty
of her subjects was expected to manifest itself by
ignoring her presence.  If you saw the Sovereign
approaching you effaced yourself.  You slipped
behind a tree or looked over the hedge or retied
your shoelaces.  You might do anything except
be aware of this august lady's presence and
recognize it by the usual salute and the bared head
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P346"></a>346}</span>
as she went by.  The Queen was ever, as her
son was, insistent upon etiquette.  No form of
ceremony must be neglected.  But at Balmoral the
etiquette consisted in the absence of all form
or ceremony outdoors.  You were expected to
know this, and if you did not know it but stood at
attention with lifted hat this mark of homage
would not be well received.  I once heard a
stranger who had offended in this way say that
the look upon the Queen's face as she passed
was a lesson not to be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Her Majesty drove quietly about in a pony
carriage with perhaps the ever faithful John
Brown in attendance to lay a shawl about her
shoulders or take one off, as he judged best.  You
might see him do as much as that in the publicity
of Hyde Park in London.  It was partly in the
simplicity of this Highland life that the Queen
found repose.  Her Majesty would sometimes
stop at Invercauld House for tea, apparently as
one neighbour appealing to the hospitality of
another.  But I imagine these impulses were
announced beforehand and that the list of guests
at Invercauld was known at Balmoral.  During
one week there was among them a lady who, for
purely technical reasons, was never received at
Court though she went almost everywhere else in
London and had, and has, a position almost
unique.  But so long as this lady remained at
Invercauld House the Queen found herself too
much occupied with business of State to come to
tea.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P347"></a>347}</span>
</p>

<p>
Royalty knows, or knows about, almost everybody.
The late King was always the best informed
man in his dominions.  It was rare that
he met a man or woman whose face and history
were not familiar to him.  He did once at
Dunrobin Castle.  This was not many years ago, when
the King and Queen were circumnavigating this
island-part of their Empire in the royal yacht.
The yacht anchored for some days in the bay off
the castle.  The King or Queen, or both, came
ashore during the day and returned to sleep on
board.  As the King, the Duke of Sutherland,
and Captain Hedworth Lambton, commander
of the yacht, were walking up from the pier
through the gardens to the castle, a man passed
them.  "Who is that?" asked the King.  The
Duke had to admit he could not tell.  "Oh, sir,"
said Captain Lambton, "don't you know the
castle is full of people whom the Duke doesn't
know and the Duchess never sees?"  The King
took this pleasantry as it was meant; aware that
there was beneath it just that evanescent
adumbration of fact which made it plausible.
</p>

<p>
Captain Lambton, then the Hon. Hedworth
Lambton, brother to the present Earl of Durham,
is now Admiral the Hon. Sir Hedworth Lambton,
K.C.B., the youngest man of his rank in the service;
or was when he was made admiral.  Noted for
the quaint felicity of his sayings, sometimes with
an edge to them; noted for his service with the
Naval Brigade in South Africa and the relief of
Ladysmith; noted as a skilful seaman who had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P348"></a>348}</span>
commanded the cruiser division of the Mediterranean
fleet and afterward the China squadron.
The Lambtons are a family apart, and Sir
Hedworth is a man apart, even amid his own family.
There are few men who give you a stronger
impression of having made their own that rule of
life which consists in taking things as they come.
Struggling through the watercourses of the veldt
with his 4.10 gun, or on the quarter-deck of the
royal yacht in harbour with only duties of
ceremony to perform, he is the same man.
</p>

<p>
He came to Dalmeny House for the week-end
while the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> was lying at
Queensferry.  On the Sunday morning he asked Lord
Rosebery and his house-party to go with him to the
yacht for morning service.  We drove through
the charming park to the Leuchold Gate and so
to Queensferry pier, whence a launch took us on
board.  The yacht has a displacement of
something more than five thousand tons.  Those
external lines of beauty which you expect in a
yacht had been omitted by the Admiralty
designers responsible for this vessel, but once on
board everything is admirable.  The ship was
lying in the Forth, above the bridge, waiting for
Queen Alexandra to embark for Copenhagen.
Nothing could be smarter than the decks and
the crew except the officers; all in full uniform.
</p>

<p>
It was August, and though some Americans say
the sun never shines on these islands, there are
moments of exception and this was one.  It was
burning hot.  Captain Lambton read the service,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P349"></a>349}</span>
his officers and guests about him, the men in front,
all amidships on the upper deck.  He came to
the Lord's Prayer, the sailors all kneeling and all
caps off.  In the very middle of it, without a
change of intonation or accent, he said to his men:
"If anybody feels the sun they may put their
caps on."  I suppose a super-devout churchman
might have been shocked, but the reader was
captain of the ship and he had no idea of allowing
one of his men to have a touch of sunstroke.  It
appears they were in no danger for not one of them
put on his cap.  Nor did any one seem to think
his captain's interlocutory sentence out of place.
I have seen often enough both in the navy and in
the army that the most rigid disciplinarian may be
of all others the most careful of his men's health
and comfort.
</p>

<p>
In these Dreadnought days nothing of the
pre-Dreadnought period counts.  But I was once
on I believe, the first Dreadnought, of a type long
since antiquated, with a low freeboard forward
and the whole expanse of the forecastle deck so
arranged as to be, with reference to the rest of
the vessel, a lever on which the Atlantic might
pile itself up.  I asked the captain what might
happen in a heavy head sea.  "The chances are,"
he answered coolly, "she would go down head
foremost."  However, at the moment she was
comfortably anchored off Queensferry.
</p>

<p>
That danger exists no longer for the model is
obsolete, and this particular ship no doubt went
long since to the scrap heap.  But the unsolved
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P350"></a>350}</span>
problems of naval warfare are still numerous.  A
fighting admiral in the British navy will tell you
strange things if he happens to be in a talkative
mood.  Nothing is better worth listening to
than the discourse of a man who has command
of a great fleet or of a great ship, whether of war
or commerce.  I quote one sentence:
</p>

<p>
"You want to know what is likely to happen
when two modern battle fleets meet at sea, equal
in fighting strength and under equal conditions.
No man knows.  It has never yet happened.
But the chances are both would go to the bottom."
</p>

<p>
Out of many Highland incidents I choose one,
for brevity's sake.
</p>

<p>
Invermark.  A place renowned for many kinds
of sport, salmon fishing included.  It belonged,
when I knew it, to the late Lord Dalhousie, who
generally let it and confined himself to Brechin
Castle, with excursions to Panmure House.
Invermark was a lodge and nothing more; just room
for half a dozen guests and their guns and servants.
Lord Dudley and the late Lord Hindlip had it
together one year.  Lord Hindlip was the head
of the great brewery firm of Allsopp &amp; Co.  He
announced to us one night at dinner that he must
go to London next morning on business.  He
went, returning two days later.  He had spent
twelve hours in London.  Somebody said "I
hope your business turned out all right."  Lord
Hindlip answered: "I don't know about all right.
I bought £750,000 ($3,750,000) worth of hops
a price which makes it impossible there should
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P351"></a>351}</span>
be any profit in the next twelve months'
brewing."  Nobody asked but everybody looked another
question: "Then why buy?"  Lord Hindlip
continued his sentence as if he had not noticed our
curiosity.  "But if I had not bought yesterday
there would have been no brewing of beer at all
for the next twelve months, nor perhaps ever."
</p>

<p>
This was one of the houses&mdash;perhaps only those
belonging to the great brewers&mdash;where beer was
served with the cheese instead of port.  But not
the kind of beer known to the ordinary mortal.
Beer specially brewed, long kept, tenderly cared
for, and somehow transformed into a transcendental
fluid, transparent, golden in colour, nectar to
the taste, strangely mild on the palate, but swiftly
finding its way to the brain if you were ensnared
into drinking a tumblerful.  There was nothing
to warn you unless your host warned you, which
he generally did not.  He perhaps rather pressed
it upon you as they do the Audit ale at Trinity
College, Cambridge, with a hospitality not free
from guile.  That I knew through the late
Mr. Justice Denham, who was my host, and when I
resisted he told me how Lord Chancellor Campbell
had praised the mildness of the ale, and had a
second drink, and then a third; and upon emerging
from the buttery into the fresh air found himself
embarrassed; he, the hardest head at the Bar
of his time.  A story which I hand on as a
warning to the next comer.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII
<br /><br />
FAMOUS ENGLISHMEN NOT IN POLITICS
</h3>

<p class="t3b">
I
</p>

<p>
There are, perhaps, a few names of to-day
which it is possible to mention without
becoming involved in the politics of to-day.  The
English, it is true, draw a broader line between
what is purely political and what is personal than
we do.  They can give and take hard knocks,
whether in Parliament or on the platform or even
in the Press, without animosity or resentment.
But since in America it seems to be supposed that
any reference to these encounters may have its
danger side I avoid them for the present.  I turn
away from the Revolutionary present, of which
one's stock of Memories increases day by day, to
the more peaceful past or to a more peaceful
world in the present; a world unravaged by political
passions.  True, the past was not always a
peaceful past while it lasted.  We do not always
remember how fierce were the storms which have
subsided.  But where Death has made a solitude
we call it peace.
</p>

<p>
In two, at least, of the great contests waged
these periods of peace I had a share, which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P353"></a>353}</span>
I must mention again for the sake of another story
I have to tell.  One was the conflict about Irish
Home Rule which became critical and revolutionary
in 1881 and 1886; when I was allowed to
state my own views, unpopular as they were in
America, in <i>The Tribune</i> week by week or day
by day; a policy of generous and far-sighted
courage on the part of that journal; honourable
to its editor and I hope in the long run not
injurious to the paper.
</p>

<p>
The second was in 1895 and 1896, in <i>The Times</i>
of London.  When President Cleveland flung his
message of war upon the floor of the House at
Washington in December, 1895, I necessarily had
much to say about it in <i>The Times</i>.  There again
I was given a free hand.  It is sometimes said
that the correspondents of this journal frame their
news dispatches in accordance with orders issued
to them from the home office.  I can only say,
if indeed I may say so much without violating
obligations of secrecy, that during a service which
lasted ten years I never knew of or heard of any
such orders.
</p>

<p>
Coming to England in the summer of 1896 on a
holiday, I had some slight illness and asked a
friend whom I should consult.  My own doctor
was by that time attending patients, I suppose, in
another and better world.  My friend said he had
lately seen fourteen physicians about his son and
each of the fourteen had given a different name
to his son's disease.
</p>

<p>
"Then I went to Dr. Barlow, who said, after a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P354"></a>354}</span>
long examination, 'I do not know what is the
matter with your son nor what to prescribe for
him.'  Then I felt I had found a doctor whom I
could trust."
</p>

<p>
So I went to Dr. Barlow, without an introduction.
At the end of a rather long consultation
and a definite opinion and a settled prescription,
I asked what his fee was.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
I thought he had misunderstood my question,
and repeated it.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  I can take no money from a man
who has done as much as you have to keep the
peace between the two countries."
</p>

<p>
When I next saw the manager of <i>The Times</i> I
told him of this incident, which he seemed to think
interesting.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"Such evidences of good feeling from a man so
distinguished as Barlow and so far removed from
politics do indeed make for good feeling on both
sides.  I hope you will tell all your own people."
</p>

<p>
It is difficult, for I cannot tell it without more
or less directly paying a compliment to myself.
But many years have since ebbed away.  Modesty
is at best but an inconvenient handmaiden, from
whom I would part company if I could.  Let her
keep to her proper place.  An obligation of honour
is peremptory; and this, perhaps, is one.  I did
tell a certain number of friends at the time, and
now I repeat the anecdote to a larger number.  I
set it against Mr. Price Collier's mischievous
dictum that English and Americans do not like each
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P355"></a>355}</span>
other.  The dictum already seems to belong to a
distant and misty and mythical past.
</p>

<p>
Since that year of 1896 Dr. Barlow has become
(in 1902) Sir Thomas Barlow, Bart., and Physician
to the King's Household; about as high as anybody
can go in the medical profession.  A Lancashire
lad to begin, with, he has had a vast hospital
experience, and still keeps up his hospital work;
he has a vast private practice; Harvard and two
Canadian universities have given him their LL.D.;
he is an F.R.S., a K.C.V.O., and other parts of
the alphabet pay him tribute.  All these and
many other titles and distinctions have their
value, though the late Sir Henry Drummond
Wolff, who had more than most men, did say:
"They give me every kind of letter to my name
except L.S.D."  But the essential thing in Sir
Thomas Barlow's case is that he has the confidence
of the public and of his profession.
</p>

<p>
One thing, it seems to me, the great surgeons
and physicians I have known had in common.
They were great men, first of all.  They had
great qualities outside of their profession.  Two
years ago last September, a time when the big
men are mostly away, I wanted a surgeon and
knew not where to find one.  A chemist finally
gave me a name, Mr. Henry Morris, and an
address; name wholly unknown to me, though the
address, Cavendish Square, implied at least
professional prosperity.  I had had a fall at the
Playhouse, as Mr. Maude calls his little theatre,
the night before, leaving a box by what I supposed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P356"></a>356}</span>
to be steps and in the absence of steps coming
down on the floor, bruised, and I knew not what
else.  My surgeon made his examination.  What
struck me was that he wasted never a word nor a
gesture.  The touch of his hands, of his fingers,
had a mathematical or instrumental precision.  So
had his questions.  In five minutes or less he had
covered the ground and delivered his opinion.
Anything might have happened, but nothing had,
bar the bruised muscles.  "We'll attend to those
for you."  He asked if I was leaving town and
when I said I was sailing for New York on Saturday
he remarked:
</p>

<p>
"If you were a working-man I should send you
to the hospital and you would be kept in bed till
you were well.  But if you choose to sail on the
<i>Lusitania</i> you must bear the pain.  Now, as you
are here, you might as well let me overhaul you."
</p>

<p>
Then, as before, the same precision, the same
delicacy of touch, the same rapidity, nothing
hurried, nothing missed; his examination a work
of art as well as of science.  Then he began to
talk of other things; and again, and even stronger,
was the impression of being in contact with a
master mind.  Seldom have I spent a more
stimulating hour.  He was, I found later, Mr. Henry
Morris, Consulting Surgeon to the Middlesex
Hospital and President of the Royal College of
Surgeons.  In other words, Mr. Henry Morris,
about whom I ought to have known, but did not,
was, and is, in the very front rank of his profession.
His eminence has since been recognized and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P357"></a>357}</span>
rewarded by the King, and he is now Sir Henry
Morris, Bart.  I suppose even a Republican may
admit that if titles are to be conferred they are
well conferred on men eminent in science.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">
II
</p>

<p>
Sir Thomas Barlow has since been elected President
of the Royal College of Physicians in succession
to Sir Douglas Powell.  This is the Blue
Ribbon of the profession, perhaps a greater honour
than a knighthood or baronetcy, though the
knighthood or the baronetcy is from the King,
the source and fountain of all such distinctions.
But the Presidency of the Royal College of Physicians
is conferred by the Profession itself.  The
Fellows of the College, who number some three
hundred, are the choosing body.  They vote by
ballot and the man whom they elect is the man
by whom they wish to be represented before the
public; the man by whom they are content to be
judged.  They say, in effect, of him whom they
choose: "This is the Head of the Medical
Profession for the time being."  The public, which
really and rightly has much more confidence in
the judgment of the doctors upon each other
than in any lay reputation, accepts that.  When
you say of a physician, "He is a doctors' doctor,"
you have said about all you can.
</p>

<p>
The President of the Royal College of Physicians
has, no doubt, duties which are not medical.
He has executive, administrative, consultative
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P358"></a>358}</span>
duties; and the very important duty of dining
with the Lord Mayor, the Corporation of the City
of London, and the City Companies.  In discharging
these latter functions he incurs, I suppose,
less risk than most men incur.  But risk or
no risk these feasts have to be faced.  Between
all Corporations, Guilds, and Colleges there is a
kind of freemasonry.  They have points of
contact, of sympathy, and are likely to stand by
each other in difficulties.  Whether dinners were
invented as a test and standard of friendship, I
cannot say.  But go to which of them you like,
you will find a collection of the Heads of
other Companies, Colleges, etc.; not all, perhaps,
dinner-giving, but all willing victims of others'
hospitality.
</p>

<p>
The Royal College of Physicians is also a Senate
or Parliament; with powers of legislation and of
professional guidance and discipline.  The Fellows
of this College are Trustees for the whole Profession.
The President has an authority of his own, depending
in part on statutes and on custom, in part on
his personal authority.  In the latter Sir Thomas
Barlow will not be found wanting.  It is not the
less, it is perhaps the greater, for the genial good
nature which accompanies it.  I said to him once:
</p>

<p>
"Sir Thomas, you have one quality which must
be a great drawback to your success."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, what is that?"
</p>

<p>
"When you come into a room your patient at
once thinks himself better, and even doubts
whether he need have sent for you at all, and so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P359"></a>359}</span>
gets well much quicker than he ought.  It's taking
money out of your pocket."
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  I'll take care you don't get well
too soon."
</p>

<p>
There was an electioneering story&mdash;oh, no
politics in it&mdash;the other day with an equally serious
but not more serious, side to it.  Men were discussing
the system of plural voting still prevailing
in this country and certain to prevail so long as
votes, or any votes, are based on property
qualification.  Said a well-known doctor:
</p>

<p>
"I have sixteen votes, all of which I am going
to poll."
</p>

<p>
"But how?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I have two votes of my own and I have
fourteen patients who are of the wrong party and
not one of them will be well enough to go out till
after election."
</p>

<p>
Think how completely non-political must be a
profession of which an eminent member can tell a
story like that and run no risk of being misunderstood.
The traditions of honour are indeed high
among English doctors, nor could they be in
better keeping than now in Sir Thomas Barlow's.
</p>

<p>
One of his predecessors, Sir William Gull, was
also not merely fashionable and popular but
recognized by his associates as a scientific
practitioner.  Sir William Jenner was perhaps reckoned
by the medical profession the best all-round man
ever known.  Sir William Gull was not far off, yet
there is an anecdote of him which suggests that
he put a very high value on the average capacity
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P360"></a>360}</span>
of doctors.  He was asked to go a long distance
into the country to see a patient.  He declined.
He was told that any fee he liked to name would
be gladly paid.  Still he declined, saying there
were cases he could not leave, and when he was
pressed further the great man burst out:
</p>

<p>
"But why do you want me?  There are five
hundred doctors in London just as good as I am."
</p>

<p>
Which perhaps was not quite true.
</p>

<p>
Sir William Broadbent said almost the same
thing to me, twenty years ago and more, when I
asked him to see Mr. Hay whom I had just left
in his rooms, in Ryder Street, St. James's, to all
appearance extremely ill.  Hay said in his
emotional way:
</p>

<p>
"Broadbent is the only doctor I believe in.  If
you don't bring Broadbent bring nobody.  Let
me die."
</p>

<p>
But Broadbent said no.  He was starting to
catch a train for a life and death consultation in
the country.  He must not miss his train.
</p>

<p>
"But there's time enough.  See Hay on your
way to the train.  Give him five minutes and let
somebody else do the rest."
</p>

<p>
"I shall let somebody else do the whole."
</p>

<p>
"Hay will see nobody unless he sees you first."
</p>

<p>
"There are plenty of men as good as I am.  I
will give you half a dozen names."
</p>

<p>
"I want none of them.  I want you.  You know
you can stop your carriage for five minutes as you
drive to the station."
</p>

<p>
"My carriage has not come round."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P361"></a>361}</span>
</p>

<p>
"My hansom is at the door.  Drive with me and
let your carriage follow."
</p>

<p>
Finally he did.  When he came out of Hay's
bedroom he was a very angry man.  He said:
</p>

<p>
"Your friend has a bad attack of indigestion.
He will be all right in an hour."
</p>

<p>
And away he went.  An angry man is not always
a just man.  Hay&mdash;God bless his memory&mdash;thought
himself suffering from a heart attack.
There is, I believe, a medical analogy between the
symptoms of heart disease and violent indigestion.
I had left him lying on the floor almost in
convulsions.  How was he to know it was not heart
disease, to which he believed himself subject?
Hay was not then, to the English, so great a man
as he afterwards became.  He had not been
Ambassador, nor Secretary of State, nor dictated to
the European Powers a new policy in the East.
I ought not to use the word dictated.  It is not
descriptive of Hay's methods, which were persuasive.
Nor does one Power dictate to another.  Let
us say he had secured by the adroit use of accepted
diplomatic methods the adhesion of the European
Powers to his proposals in respect of China.  No
American Secretary of State had ever made so
original or beneficent a use of his power.  He had
brought his country once for all into the great
world-partnership of great Powers the world over.
</p>

<p>
Sir William Broadbent did not foresee that.
He could not.  If he had he might have been less
angry, for he was thought to be considerate of
greatness in all its forms or in many of them.  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P362"></a>362}</span>
liked patients of distinction, which is no reproach.
He had many of them.  But the odd thing was
that he seemed never quite able to overcome his
awe of rank and title.  In a company of persons
of rank his manner was not that of an equal.  He
used to address persons of rank as a servant
addresses them; or it might be kinder to say as
inferiors in position used to address their superiors
two or three generations ago.  And always with
embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
Another celebrated man of medicine, Sir Andrew
Clark, had an almost factitious renown as
Mr. Gladstone's doctor, and Mr. Gladstone was a very
good patient, in one sense.  One thing this famous
physician had; he had absolute confidence in himself.
Or, if no doctor has that, he had enough to give
his patient confidence, which is perhaps not less
important.  Old Abernethy used to say: "The
second best remedy is best if the patient thinks it
best."  And I suppose that is as true of doctors
as of remedies.  If Sir Andrew doubted, he never
allowed you to see that he doubted.  Like all these
great men, he had a social as well as medical
popularity and he was very good company at
dinner and after.
</p>

<p>
One evening I met him at a pleasant house
where there was a good cook and the company,
including the host, did not exceed six; all men.
We all noticed that Sir Andrew drank champagne.
Presently one of the men said:
</p>

<p>
"You don't allow us champagne, Sir Andrew,
but you allow it to yourself."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P363"></a>363}</span>
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I have had a long day, and I am very tired,
and I must have it.  Besides, when I get home
there'll be thirty or forty letters to answer."
</p>

<p>
So the champagne flowed on, like the water, as
Mr. Evarts said, at one of President Hayes's White
House dinners.  Sir Andrew drank no more than
anybody else.  It was only because of his habit
of prohibiting it to others that we noticed whether
his glass was full or empty.  As we went upstairs
I said to him:
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that after all that champagne
you are going to answer thirty or forty letters
when you get home?"
</p>

<p>
"No, certainly not."
</p>

<p>
"Then what did you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"What I meant was that after my champagne
I should not care whether they were answered or
not."
</p>

<p>
It was Sir Andrew Clark who said of Mr. Gladstone,
some fifteen years before his death at eighty-eight
that there was no physiological reason why
he should not live to be 120.  If that was meant
as a prophecy it had the fate of most prophecies.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVIII
<br /><br />
LORD ST. HELIER&mdash;AMERICAN AND ENGLISH METHODS&mdash;MR. BENJAMIN
</h3>

<p>
If you care for a clear view of English life and
of Englishmen you need not always go to the
mountain tops in search of it.  If you can find
a man who stands for what is typical, who is in
the front rank, but not among the very foremost,
who has, in a high degree, the qualities by which
the average Englishman, having them in a much
less degree, succeeds, he is as well worth studying
for this purpose as the most illustrious of them
all.  I could name many such men.  I will take
one whom I knew well for many years; to whose
kindness I owed much; whom I saw often in
London and stayed with often in the country; for
whose memory I have that kind of affection which
survives even a sense of many obligations.  I mean
Lord St. Helier.
</p>

<p>
He was Mr. Francis Jeune when I first knew
him, and when he married Mrs. Stanley.  Later
he became Sir Francis Jeune, and finally found
his way into that House of Lords which it is now
the fashion among one set of politicians to decry.
I suppose nobody would deny that, whatever
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P365"></a>365}</span>
be the merits or demerits of the hereditary
principle, this House contains more distinguished and
supremely able men than any other body that
can be named.  For such a man as Francis Jeune
it was the natural and pre-ordained abode when
his honourable career reached or approached its
climax.
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis Jeune was a man who made the
most of his abilities and opportunities.  He was
a good lawyer, a good judge, and, after his marriage
with Mrs. Stanley, a considerable social force.
It is among the peculiarities of English life that the
Presidency of the Divorce Court should be one
of four great prizes at the English Bar.  The Lord
High Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, and the
Master of the Rolls hold the other three most
coveted places, and are rewarded by appointments
such as the legal profession in no other country can
hope for.  The dignity of all these positions is
very great, and the pay corresponds to the dignity.
</p>

<p>
If we contrast the splendid figures with the
salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court at
the United States, the motto of the Republic
would seem to be Hamlet's "Thrift, thrift,
Horatio."  But if the levelling doctrines of the present
day were to prevail, the British judges would soon
descend to the money level of the American.  I do
not imagine they will.  The illiberal treatment of
public servants has never been popular in England.
</p>

<p>
There is nevertheless something in these high
legal posts which attracts men to whom the pay,
high as it is, can be no attraction.  But that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P366"></a>366}</span>
again only sharpens the contrast.  The average
income of the magnates at the American Bar
being greater than at the English, and the salaries
of the American judges being less than half those
of the English judges, why should an American
lawyer of the first class ever accept a judicial
office?  Clearly there are other and higher motives
than mere money.  There are Americans, we are
told, who recognize in American life no motive
higher than money.  But are they Americans, or
are they of the true American type?  You might
have asked Mr. Roosevelt when he was here last
May.  He is the most famous of living Americans
and he certainly did not become so by the worship
of money.
</p>

<p>
I have strayed far from Sir Francis Jeune, but
the law and the things of the law must ever have
an attraction for any one who has at any time, no
matter how long ago, been in contact with them;
otherwise than as a client.  And I will stray further
still in order to add that one of the greatest names
at the English Bar, and now one of the greatest
memories, is that of an American.  I mean, of
course, Mr. Benjamin.  He had no superior.  It
is doubtful whether he had an equal in those duties
of his profession in which he most cared to excel.
I knew him a little.  He sometimes talked to me
of his career; surely the most remarkable at the
English or perhaps any other Bar, since he was
fifty-three when he came to this country.  He
always acknowledged heartily the kindness shown
him, the facilities given him, the aid even of men
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P367"></a>367}</span>
who foresaw in him a dangerous rival, to make
his path smooth.  I said to him once:
</p>

<p>
"But you came here as the representative of a
Lost Cause which the English had at one time
almost made their own.  That may have helped."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; the friendship of the governing classes
in England for the Confederacy had passed into
history.  They had discovered their mistake.  As
they would say, they had backed the wrong horse.
It was still some years to the Geneva Arbitration
but they had begun to be aware they would have
to pay, as others do when they put their money
on a loser.  However, I don't think that counted
one way or the other.  What did count was the
good-will of English lawyers to another lawyer.
That you can always depend on.  They shortened
the formalities.  They opened the doors as wide
as they could.  And never once when I had gained
a foothold did I find that anybody remembered I
was not English; or remembered it to my disadvantage."
</p>

<p>
Taking his place as he did at the very head, he
was a memorable illustration of Daniel Webster's
well-known reply to the young lawyer who asked
him if the profession was not overcrowded:
</p>

<p>
"There is always room at the top."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Benjamin passed swiftly from penury to
affluence.  He told me once what his highest
earnings in any one year had been.  The amount
was larger by many thousands of pounds than the
income of his chief competitor.  It was larger, I
think, than any English lawyer now makes except
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P368"></a>368}</span>
at the Parliamentary Bar, where the figures are
almost fantastic.  This is a money test but apply
any other you like and you would still see the
figure of Mr. Benjamin standing out from among
the crowd and high above it; and above even the
highest of that day.
</p>

<p>
I dined lately at the Inner Temple as the guest
of a great and successful lawyer.  There was a
company of other successful lawyers and of judges.
I asked a question or two about Benjamin.  In
that perfectly rarefied legal atmosphere there could
be none but a purely legal opinion.  And there
was but one opinion.  Most of these men had
known him, though Benjamin died in 1884.
Whether they knew him or not they knew all about
him.  His greatness was admitted.  Eulogies were
poured out on him.
</p>

<p>
"Did his American nationality hinder him?"
</p>

<p>
"It neither hindered nor helped.  He was at
the English Bar and that was enough."
</p>

<p>
I come back to Sir Francis Jeune.  He was the
friend and legal adviser of Lord Beaconsfield,
whose will he drew.  A Conservative, of course.
His practice at the Bar was never of a showy
kind.  But if you put yourself into his hands you
felt sure he would do the right and wise thing.
His mind was of the sort known as legal.  When
he came to the Bench it was seen to be judicial
also.  I suppose the general public has never
understood why Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty
should be united in one division of the Supreme
Court.  No two subjects could be more unlike
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P369"></a>369}</span>
than Divorce and Admiralty.  But a judge is
supposed to have taken all legal knowledge to be
his province, and to be equally capable of dealing
with all the mysteries of the law in all its relations
to all parts of life.  It is true that on the Admiralty
side assessors are called in.  An assessor is a kind
of expert.  A retired sea-captain, for example, who
has never commanded anything but a sailing ship,
is supposed to be competent to advise on the most
intricate questions of modern steamship navigation.
The result is sometimes astounding, as in the case
of the <i>Campania</i>, condemned by Mr. Justice
Gorell Barnes to pay for the loss of the bark
<i>Embolton</i>, by collision, solely because she was
steaming nine knots.  It was proved that this was
the safest speed for her and for all comers; that
she was under better control at nine knots than
at any less speed.  But the court said: "If people
will build ships which are safest at nine knots
they must be responsible for the consequences."
</p>

<p>
Sir Francis Jeune had no part in the trial of this
famous cause and I am sure had too much sense
to agree with the judgment.  Good sense was,
perhaps, the predominant trait in his character.
He showed it pre-eminently in the Divorce Court.
There he was helped, no doubt, by his social
experiences.  He knew London as few men know it.
He had, in such matters, almost feminine instincts.
But he ruled in his court as all strong English
judges rule, and as strong American judges do not.
In America we say of an advocate: "He tried such
and such a case."  In England the phrase is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P370"></a>370}</span>
never used of the barrister.  It is the judge who
"tries" the cause, as it ought to be.  Sir Francis
"tried" the causes that came before him.  He
knew the law.  He mastered facts easily.  He
was not easily misled and he had the sagacity
which led him quickly to right conclusions.  Since
his death there have been contrasts on which I
will not dwell.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX
<br /><br />
MRS. JEUNE, LADY JEUNE, AND LADY ST. HELIER
</h3>

<p>
The interesting people are the exceptional
people; not those cast in a mould common
to others, not those whose lives run in a groove
but those who fashion their own lives in obedience
to the dictates of a nature which is their own.
Among the women of London it would be easy to
choose those of higher rank or greater position
than Lady St. Helier, but I choose her because
she is Lady St. Helier.
</p>

<p>
Whether the marriage of Mrs. Stanley to Mr. Francis
Jeune, in 1881, was or was not considered
a social event of the first importance I cannot say.
I was not then in London.  But that it became
important in no long time is clear.  It was first as
Mrs. Jeune and then as Lady Jeune that the
present Lady St. Helier achieved her great
distinction as a hostess.  She was not content to do
what other ladies of position were in the habit of
doing.  She struck out a line for herself.  I said
lately that London was a world in which everything
of the first rank in many differing ranks and professions
met at times beneath the same roofs.  That was
not always true.  It was very far from being true.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P372"></a>372}</span>
</p>

<p>
If you go back no further than the eighteenth
century you find in England a society consisting of
perhaps three hundred or four hundred persons.
If we may judge by the memoirs and memories
that have come down to us it was a very brilliant
society, perhaps more brilliant, though less varied,
than the society of to-day.  But it was not
comprehensive, still less was it cosmopolitan.  It was
a caste.  The hereditary principle prevailed.  It
was a society into which you had to take the
precaution to be born.  If you were not born into
it you never found your way in.  There was no
effort to keep people outside of it.  None was
required.  The people who were outside did not
dream of forcing themselves in.  There was no
reason why this little clique should be on the
defence.  The Climbers did not then exist, as an
aggressive body, or as a force of any kind.  If
you read Boswell's Life, or Walpole's Letters, or
the Life of Selwyn, or any political memoirs of the
time, it is clear that the dividing line between
those who were in society and those who were
not was a broad one, and was all but impassable.
</p>

<p>
It has long ceased to be, and the steps by which
it was worn away can be traced.  But if we come
at once to the 'eighties of the last century we see
a condition of things which, a hundred years before
that, would have seemed to the social leaders of
that day fantastic.  The revolution had gone far;
it had already become an evolution; and, of
course, the end was not yet.  It needed a Mrs. Jeune
to carry it on to its full development.  And
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P373"></a>373}</span>
since the individual is but one expression of those
natural forces which are, in such cases, the
operative forces, there is no reason why Nature should
not supply the individual as she does the other
energies needed for the work she has in hand.
At any rate, she supplied Mrs. Jeune, and London
is to-day a different place from the London we
should have known had there been no Mrs. Jeune.
</p>

<p>
For Society, in the mixed form now prevailing,
is supposed to be not only a compromise between
conflicting forces but the result of much careful
diplomacy.  Lady Jersey was a diplomatist.  Lady
Palmerston was a diplomatist.  The late King was
pre-eminently a diplomatist.  Whether from
temperament or calculation I know not, but
Mrs. Jeune cast diplomacy to the winds.  The one
gift which stood to her in the place of all others
was courage.  She brought together at the same
table, or under the same roof at Arlington Manor,
people the most unlike.  Each one of her guests
had some kind of distinction, or some claim to
social recognition.  They might or might not
have anything in common.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. George Cornwallis West, whom we still
think of as Lady Randolph Churchill, once gave
at her house in Connaught Place, by the Marble
Arch, looking out on Hyde Park, what she called
a dinner of deadly enemies.  It was thought a
hazardous experiment.  It proved a complete
success.  They were all well-bred people.  They
all recognized their obligations to their hostess as
paramount for the time being.  They were Lady
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P374"></a>374}</span>
Randolph's guests.  That was enough.  As guests
they were neither friends nor enemies.  There were
no hostilities.  The talk flowed on smoothly.
When a man found himself sent in to dinner with
a woman to whom he did not speak, his tongue
was somehow unloosed.  It was a truce.  In some
cases ancient animosities were softened.  In all
they were suspended.  The guests all knew each
other, and as they looked about the table they all
saw that Lady Randolph had attempted the
impossible and had conquered.  A social miracle
had been performed.
</p>

<p>
What Lady Randolph did for that one evening
Mrs. Jeune did night after night and year after
year.  There was not on her part, I presume, any
conscious intention of bringing irreconcilables into
contact with each other.  What Mrs. Jeune did
was simply to take no note of the fact that they
were irreconcilables.  Her policy, if policy it were,
had therefore the kind of validity which comes
to a man or to a woman from not appearing to be
aware of the obvious.  That is a great resource in
debate, and a great resource in that larger debate
which broadens into human intercourse.  The
average man is rather apt to do what he sees is
expected of him.  As a guest he has hardly a
choice.  When he enters a front door he puts
himself under the dominion of his hostess.  If he
is a man of the world, his philosophy is to take
what is offered him.  If he is not, he is chiefly
concerned to do as others do whom he supposes
to be more familiar than himself with the manners
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P375"></a>375}</span>
and customs of Society.  Very rarely therefore
does anything like a collision occur and almost
never so long as the company is of two sexes.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jeune may or may not have thought this
out, or she may have acted from those intuitions
which in women supply the place of reason and
are, for all social purposes and some others, more
useful than reason.  People who did not like her
used to say that all she cared for was to get
celebrities together.  They professed to think she was
a Mrs. Leo Hunter and her collections of guests so
many menageries.  If that had been so they would
soon have been dispersed, nor would Mrs. Jeune,
or the Lady Jeune of later days, or the present
Lady St. Helier, ever have attained to the rank
she did as hostess.  She offered Society what
nobody else offered, novelty, which is the one thing
Society craves beyond all others.  Said a man
who went everywhere:
</p>

<p>
"I go to Lady Jeune's because I never know
whom I shall meet, but I know there will always
be somebody I shall like to meet."
</p>

<p>
By the side of which I will set an anecdote not
unlike it.  At a dinner I was next a lady who knew
everybody, and there was a man at table whom
she did not know.  She asked:
</p>

<p>
"Who is that?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Justice Stephen."
</p>

<p>
"Why have I never seen him?  He looks a man
everybody ought to know.  But it is a rare
pleasure to meet somebody you do not know."
</p>

<p>
I will give the other side in another anecdote.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P376"></a>376}</span>
A smart party.  A stream of guests coming up a
famous staircase.  Two in a balcony looking down
on the arrivals.
</p>

<p>
He: "Who is that?"
</p>

<p>
She: "I don't know."
</p>

<p>
He: "But you know everybody."
</p>

<p>
She: "Nobody knows everybody."
</p>

<p>
There spoke the voice of authority.  Society in
London is now so multitudinous that even a
bowing acquaintance between its less conspicuous
members is not universal.  It was Lady Jeune's
mission to bring together those who stood apart.
She swept into her net many a foreigner who but
for her might have remained a foreigner.  I will
venture to guess that Lady St. Helier's invitation
was one of the few unofficial invitations which
Mr. Roosevelt accepted for his brief stay in London.
They met twenty years ago or more when
Mr. Roosevelt was in London, and made friends.  He
used to make friendly inquiries about Mrs. Jeune,
as Mrs. Jeune did about him, year by year, and I
often carried friendly messages from each to the
other.  She will surround him with delightful
people, among whom there will be one or two or
three he had never heard of; and when he has met
them will wonder he had not known them always.
</p>

<p>
Lady St. Helier has published a book of Reminiscences
which I have not yet read.  I am therefore
borrowing a little of her courage in giving my
own account of some matters which she may have
dealt with, and perhaps from a different point of
view.  But I must take that risk.  I prefer taking
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P377"></a>377}</span>
it.  If my testimony, or anybody's testimony, is to
have any value it must be from its independence.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Jeune lived for many years in Wimpole
Street; then moved to Harley Street, and then,
after Lord St. Helier's death, in 1905, to Portland
Place.  Their place in the country was Arlington
Manor, near Newbury, in Berkshire, the scene
of the battle, in 1643, in which Lord Falkland,
despairing of peace, says his biographer, threw his
life away.  There stands a monument on the
battlefield erected not many years ago with an
inscription by the late Lord Carnarvon, himself a
kind of nineteenth-century Falkland, who threw
away his political future in an impossible attempt
to come to terms with Mr. Parnell, Lord Carnarvon
also despairing of peace.  The inscription is
a piece of literature for ever.
</p>

<p>
At Arlington it was Lady Jeune's delight to
gather about her some of the men and women she
really liked, and who really liked her.  The house
was not large, and was devoid of all other
splendour than such as the beauty of its position and
view and park and gardens gave it.  But it was
the home of comfort and charm.  Now it has
passed into other hands and Lady St. Helier has
built herself another house, known as Cold Ash.
But the memories of Arlington will never pass.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was in Arlington that Lady Jeune's
gifts as hostess were to be seen at their best.  It
is one thing to take charge of a dinner, another to
handle a difficult team from Saturday to Monday,
or often longer.  Freedom of choice is a thing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P378"></a>378}</span>
which has to be paid for.  But to her this was no
task.  She had good hands, and a touch so delicate
that you were guided without knowing you had
a bit in your mouth.  It was a skill which all
depended on kindness and sympathy; and these
belonged to her in overflowing measure.

<h3>
CHAPTER XL
<br /><br />
LORD AND LADY ARTHUR RUSSELL AND THE "SALON" IN ENGLAND
</h3>

<p>
The recent death of Lady Arthur Russell
diminished by one the number of accomplished
women of this generation who were
distinguished in the last generation also.  And it
closed one of the few drawing-rooms in London
which have been <i>salon</i> as well as drawing-room.
I suppose Lady Arthur herself might have said
as she looked about her and looked back, "<i>Tout
passe</i>."  The French phrase would have come
naturally to her tongue, for she was French:
daughter of that Vicomte de Peyronnet who was
Minister to Charles X.  Yet one was not often,
at any rate not too often, reminded of her French
origin.  So long ago as 1865 Mlle. de Peyronnet
married Lord Arthur Russell, brother of the ninth
Duke of Bedford and of the more famous Lord
Odo Russell, afterward the first Lord Ampthill,
long British Ambassador at Berlin, where he
managed to be on good terms both with Prince
Bismarck and the present Emperor; a feat of
diplomacy almost unique.
</p>

<p>
It is eighteen years since Lord Arthur died.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P380"></a>380}</span>
He was indisputably of the last or an earlier
generation, having little in common with the present.
People thought of Lord and Lady Arthur as one;
of itself enough to identify them with earlier
times than those when husband and wife are as
likely to be met separately as together.  If there
was a distinction it was at the breakfast hour, at
breakfasts in other houses.  There was no rule
which excluded ladies from these breakfasts, but
there was a custom which held good in the majority
of cases.  The host's wife, if he had one, might or
might not appear.  But the group of men who
were in the habit of breakfasting at each other's
houses included Lord Arthur Russell, Sir Mountstuart
Grant-Duff, Lord Reay, Mr. Charles Roundell,
Mr. Albert Rutson, sometimes Mr. Herbert
Spencer, and many more.  You will recognize
Sir Mountstuart Grant-Duff's name as that of
the most voluminous diarist of his time, and when
you have read his six or seven volumes the map
of his life is spread out before you; an honoured
and useful life, a career of real distinction.  Lord
Arthur had not Sir Mountstuart's ambitions; he
was content with his home and his kin and his
books.
</p>

<p>
His brother, the Duke, had a habit of referring
to himself as Hastings Russell.  An alteration
at Woburn Abbey was proposed to him.  "It will
not be made in the lifetime of Hastings Russell,"
his answer.  He had a sense of humour, which
Lloyd-George must think a rare thing in a
duke.  I drove once from Mentmore to Woburn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P381"></a>381}</span>
Abbey with Lady Rosebery and her little girl,
Lady Sibyl, then eight or nine years old, with a
gift of humorous perception rare at any age in her
sex.  The child had a balanced mind and a mature
view of things which might have belonged to
eighteen as well as eight.  The old place
interested her and she asked the Duke to show her the
whole.  He was delighted and took us through
room after room, each stately and each a museum.
Presently we came to a rather bare, scantily
furnished, unhandsome room, and Lady Sibyl asked:
</p>

<p>
"But what is this?"
</p>

<p>
"This, my dear, is where I earn my living
writing cheques for six hours a day."
</p>

<p>
All three brothers, the Duke, Lord Odo, and
Lord Arthur, had a quiet humour in common.
Lord Odo had, besides humour, wit.  It was he,
while Ambassador in Berlin and during a visit of
the Shah, when that great potentate practised a
less strict abstinence at dinner than his religion
demanded, who said to a neighbour: "After all,
it's nothing wonderful.  You must remember the
proverb, '<i>La nuit tous les chat sont ris</i>.  And
Berlin used to echo with his caustic, good-natured
speeches.  Nor did Berlin, nor perhaps London,
ever forget Prince Bismarck's saying:
</p>

<p>
"I never knew an Englishman who spoke French
well whom I would trust except Lord Odo."
</p>

<p>
After which I dare not name two or three others
whose French was not less perfect than that
which Prince Bismarck praised.  The Prince was
a good judge, as well he might be.  French had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P382"></a>382}</span>
become to him almost a second mother tongue; as,
indeed, it must be to a European diplomatist.
</p>

<p>
To the list of men who were to be met in those
days at breakfasts the name of Mr. George
Brodrick ought to be added.  He was a scholar,
a writer, a journalist, and one of those men who
never could understand why the world would not
come round to his way of thinking and to him.
He had real abilities, which survived a university
education.  He was born into a respectable place
in the world, of good family, with good
opportunities, but was never a man of the world.  To
be of the world in the true sense of the phrase a
man must, I take it, have a fairly accurate notion
of his relation to the world.  That Brodrick had
not.  His ambitions were political, and most of all
parliamentary; but they remained ambitions.  He
could not understand how to commend himself
to a constituency; nor would he ever have
conformed to the inexorable standards of the House
of Commons.  He expected the House and its
standards to conform to him.
</p>

<p>
Struggling with a fine courage for the unattainable,
Mr. Brodrick meantime occupied himself
with journalism, and was for many years a leader-writer
on <i>The Times</i>.  The story which points his
intense self-concentration as well as any other
connects itself with that period.  He was a guest
in a house in Scotland, and while there continued
composition of those more or less Addisonian
and rather academic essays which, when printed
on the leader page of <i>The Thunderer</i>, became
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P383"></a>383}</span>
leaders, and very good leaders of their kind.
He saw fit to write them in the drawing-room and
in the morning when men are commonly supposed
to be elsewhere.  There were ladies and they
talked.  Presently Mr. Brodrick rose, marched
over to his hostess and said to her: "Lady X., I
really must ask you to ask these ladies not to
carry on their conversation in this room.  I am
engaged upon a most important article and my
thoughts are distracted by talk which has no
importance at all."
</p>

<p>
His appearance and dress were those of a man
who gave no thought to either.  He was rather
tall, angular, uncouth, a stoop in the shoulders,
and his figure consisted of K's.  He had the
projecting teeth which French caricaturists used to
give to English "meesses," in whom it is extremely
rare.  Some person of genius untempered with
mercy called him "Curius Dentatus"; and the
nickname lasted as long as Brodrick lasted.  With
his teeth, and his knees and elbows sawing the air,
and his umbrella, and his horse all ribs, he was the
delight of the Row.  Everybody liked him but
everybody laughed at him.  In the end he
renounced journalism and renounced politics and
became Warden of Merton.  It was thought he
would not be a good Head of a College nor get
on with his students, but he falsified all predictions,
governed wisely and well, won the affection of the
boys under him, and died lamented.  I suppose the
explanation is that he had at bottom a genuine
sincerity of nature.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P384"></a>384}</span>
</p>

<p>
But I am wandering far and I return to Lady
Arthur and her house and her guests.
</p>

<p>
The form of <i>salon</i> which Lady Arthur Russell
preferred was a <i>salon</i> preceded by a dinner.  It
was never a large dinner.  Except in a few houses,
the banquets of forty or fifty people or more so
dear to the New York hostess are not given in
London, nor is mere bigness reckoned an element
of social success.  In the biggest capital of the
world, where society far exceeds in numbers the
society of any other capital, people are content
with moderation.  A dinner of forty people is a
lottery in which each guest has two chances and
no more.  His luck and his hopes of being amused
or interested depend wholly on his right- and
left-hand neighbours.
</p>

<p>
Lady Arthur, being by birth a Frenchwoman,
had French ideas on this and other subjects.  She
did not choose her guests alphabetically, nor by
rank, nor for the sake of a passing notoriety.
Lions you might meet at her house but they were
not expected to roar; nor did they.  Neither at
dinner nor after dinner were more people asked
than could be managed.  Large parties are, of
course, given in London but they do not constitute
a <i>salon</i>.  It is of the essence of a <i>salon</i> that people
shall not be left wholly to themselves, as in a large
party they must be, but shall be looked after.
Affinities do not always find themselves.  They
have to be brought together.  Others have to be
kept apart.  No authority is needed.  Intuitions,
a quick eye for situations, and a gentle skill in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P385"></a>385}</span>
distribution are the gifts which go to the making of a
good hostess.  These Lady Arthur had.  By mere
smartness she set little store.  I suppose the house
in Audley Square which Lord Arthur Russell built
never passed for a particularly smart house.  Of
houses which are called and which are "smart"
there are scores in London.  Of <i>salons</i> there are
very few.  Herself the daughter of a French
viscount, and with her husband brother to a duke,
Lady Arthur had no particular need to concern
herself about mere smartness.  That is a reputation
not altogether difficult to acquire.  The King's
smile may confer it.  Not, perhaps, the late Queen's
of whom one more than usually brilliant butterfly
remarked:
</p>

<p>
"But the Queen, you know, never was in society."
</p>

<p>
Which perhaps, in the sense intended, was true.
</p>

<p>
If there were one note more marked than another
in these Audley Square assemblies it was a note of
culture.  Ease and good breeding and distinction
may all be taken for granted.  It is of the things
which may not be taken for granted that I speak;
and culture certainly may not.  There are many
houses in London in which it is neither expected
nor desired.  In New York, as we all know, it is
discouraged.  It would be discouraged anywhere
if it were obtrusive or pedantic.  Neither in a
<i>salon</i> nor anywhere else is it to supersede good
manners, but to blend with them.  To make a <i>salon</i>
possible there must be varied interests, play of mind,
flexibility, adaptability, and an unlimited supply of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P386"></a>386}</span>
tact.  Perhaps the last includes all social gifts
except those of the intellect.  It covers a multitude
of deficiencies.  Nay, there was Miss Ada Reeve,
a clever actress who last year was discussing on
the stage questions of costume (elsewhere than on
the stage), and announced:
</p>

<p>
"If a woman has tact and diamonds she needs
nothing else."
</p>

<p>
Most of the generalities which you have been
reading are really particulars and are descriptive
of Lady Arthur Russell's receptions, of which I
have spoken as a <i>salon</i>.  I don't know that Lady
Arthur herself ever used the word, nor does it
matter.  The thing, not the name, is what matters.
There was culture, of a very unusual kind, on both
sides of the house.  There was, on Lady Arthur's
side, her French blood.  A <i>salon</i> in Paris is no rare
thing, and the reason why it is not rare is because
the society of Paris is French.  In the Faubourg
St. Germain, if nowhere else, the social traditions
of the old monarchy in its most brilliant days still
survive.
</p>

<p>
One of the noticeable things about this house
in Audley Square was the presence of distinguished
foreigners, and another was that they seemed no
longer to consider themselves foreigners.  They
were at home.  Nor was this true only of men and
women of rank who might be of kin to the Peyronnets,
and at any rate were of their world, but of artists
and men of letters.  I will take M. Renan as an
example.  He had come to London to deliver the
Hibbert lectures and a lecture on Marcus Aurelius
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P387"></a>387}</span>
before the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street,
of which the ever lamented Tyndall was then at
the head.  I had met Renan twice at other houses.
He seemed a little <i>dépaysé</i>.  In Audley Square this
exotic and troubled air had disappeared.  He had
no English&mdash;at any rate, he spoke none&mdash;and his
conversation, or the conversation of the English
with him, was therefore limited.  But when he
talked, and often when he did not, he was surrounded
by a crowd of listeners or, as the case might be,
of lookers-on.  Hence it was that he was so often
kept, or left, standing, and his physical frame was
of such a kind that long standing was irksome to
him, and even painful.  I noticed one night that
he seemed ill at ease, and said to him I hoped he
was not suffering.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "that is exactly it; I am <i>souffrant</i>,
and if I have to stand much longer I don't know
what will happen."
</p>

<p>
"But why don't you sit down?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do you think I might?"
</p>

<p>
So I took him to a comfortable sofa and, once
seated, an ineffable sweet peace stole over his
features.
</p>

<p>
A more tragic incident happened in Count von
Arnim's case, the end of whose career was all
tragedy.  At this time he was still German
Ambassador in Paris, but Prince Bismarck had become
distrustful of him and the end was not far off.  The
public, however, knew nothing; least of all the
English public, whose acquaintance with occurrences
on the Continent is apt to be remote.  For
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P388"></a>388}</span>
aught that was known in London, Count von Arnim
was still the trusted representative of Germany.
He bore a great name, he held a great position.  The
personal impression was a little disappointing.  He
did not look like the man to stand up to Prince
Bismarck, who was a giant in stature as well as in
character; nor was he.  Slight, rather short, lacking
in distinction, meagre in face, with no hint of power
in the shape of his head or in his rather furtive
expression, or in his carriage, he seemed, on the whole,
insignificant.  The eyes had no fire in them; he
looked older than his years, and unequal to his
renown.
</p>

<p>
It was the custom in those distant days to serve
tea in the drawing-room after dinner.  Count von
Arnim was asked if he would take tea, left the lady
by whom he was sitting, crossed the floor to the
tea-table, took his cup of tea from Lady Arthur's hand,
and started on his return.  The floor was of polished
oak, with here and there a rug; just the sort of
floor to which he must have been used to all his
life.  But he slipped, his feet flew from under him,
and down came the Ambassador on his back.  It
was an awful moment.  Men went to his rescue, he
was helped up, evidently much shaken, and slowly
found his way back to the sofa and to the lady
who had been his companion.  There were almost
tears in his eyes.  When, a little later, the news of
his disgrace became known, a man said: "Well,
if he could not keep his feet in a drawing-room,
what chance had he against Prince Bismarck."

<h3>
CHAPTER XLI
<br /><br />
THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY&mdash;QUEEN ALEXANDRA
</h3>

<p>
When the Radical rages against the House of
Lords he commonly selects as the most deserving
object of his wrath the Lords Spiritual.
Wicked as the Lords Temporal are, their episcopal
comrades are more wicked still.  This is, or was,
more peculiarly the Nonconformist point of view.
A Dissenter exists in order to hate a Bishop.  He
hates him as a rival in religion; a successful rival.
He hates him as the visible sign of that social
ascendancy of the Church which is to the Dissenter
not less odious than its political and ecclesiastical
primacy.
</p>

<p>
He hates him also because he is rich, or is
supposed to be so.  The Archbishop of Canterbury's
£15,000 a year, his Palace at Lambeth,
and his Old Palace at Canterbury are all alike to
the true Dissenter so many proofs of the Devil's
handiwork.  The Archbishop of York is a sinner
of less degree only because his Devil's pension is
less by £5000 a year.  The Bishop of London has
the same salary as the Archbishop of York, and his
iniquity, though he is only a Bishop, is therefore
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P390"></a>390}</span>
the same.  There is, then, a descending scale
of financial depravity.  Beginning, next after
London, with the Bishop of Durham at £7000,
we come to the Bishop of Ely with £5500, the
Bishops of Oxford, of Bath and Wells, and of
Salisbury with £5000 each, and so, by easy stages of
lessening vice, to the pauper Bishop of Sodor
and Man who gets but a pittance of £1500 a
year.
</p>

<p>
Our Dissenting friend waxes hotter as he reflects
that one Archbishop is paid three times as much as
a Prime Minister, and the other twice as much,
while three or four more Bishops receive stipends
larger than the present colleague of Mr. Lloyd-George
and Mr. Winston Churchill.  These episcopal
salaries are even higher than is that of
Mr. Lloyd-George, or that of Mr. Winston Churchill,
who has to content himself with £5000 a year while
discharging not a few of the duties of the Prime
Minister, on the platform and, if all reports be
true, in the Cabinet itself.
</p>

<p>
This, perhaps, is rather incidental.  I was
explaining why the Dissenter hates the Bishop.  The
attitude of the Bishops to the vital question of
Education augments the animosity of the Dissenter.
Their conservatism in general politics inflames their
opponents still further.  To the Nonconformist
orator they are an unfailing target, and he ought
to be very much obliged to them for supplying him
with ammunition, but is not.  Mr. Bright thundered
against them and their "adulterous origin."  Mr. Bright's
wrath, whether rightly directed or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P391"></a>391}</span>
not, was in itself a noble thing; the passion of
a great soul greatly stirred.
</p>

<p>
Just at present the Bishops are a little less
obnoxious to the Radical than usual, because they
followed the Radical lead on the Licensing Bill.
That Bill evoked animosities not less bitter than the
Education Bill.  The Bishops made it a question
of temperance, holding that by higher licensing
fees and heavier taxes on public-houses and on
liquor the consumption of spirits would be lessened.
They argued that if there were fewer public-houses
there would be fewer drinkers and drunkards.
They applauded Mr. Asquith when he proposed
that on Sundays a man should walk six miles before
he could have a glass of beer; for that is what the
<i>bona fide</i> traveller clause came to.  If they had
the influence with their fellow-Peers they are
supposed to have they could have prevented the
rejection of the Licensing Bill.  But they could not
do that.  Then the Radicals turned on them because
they could not control a House where their
very presence is to the Radical a continuing offence.
"The Brewers are stronger than the Bishops!"
cried the Radical, to whose happiness a victim of
one kind or another is essential.
</p>

<p>
The Archbishop of Canterbury led his brethren
of the Episcopal Bench in this matter of Temperance,
as he has led them on other matters.  He
is their natural leader.  He is the Primate of all
England; the Head of the Church, next after the
King.  His abilities and character are of a kind
to fit him for leadership.  I suppose it may sound
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P392"></a>392}</span>
like a paradox if I suggest that for him who holds
the highest ecclesiastical post in the land the first
requisite is that he should be a man of the world.
But it is true, and it is equally true of all Bishops.
It was true of the late Bishop Potter, who was not
only the most eminent dignitary of the American
Episcopal Church, but almost the first citizen of
New York.  The Bishops have to administer each
his own diocese, and a diocese is a province.  They
must understand how to govern.  They must
understand men and, so far as possible, women.
They must be men of affairs.  Whether they
know much Greek or Hebrew is of quite secondary
importance.  Knowledge of that kind is ornamental;
the other kind is essential.  They ought
to be diplomatists also; skilled not so much in
controversy as in avoiding controversy.
</p>

<p>
The present Archbishop is all this.  His public
career proves it, and if you come to know him he
will leave a very distinct personal impression on
your mind.  It was my fortune to meet him at
Dalmeny House not many years ago, while he was
still Bishop of Winchester.  His visit lasted some
days, and there have not been many days more
interesting.  Except for his clothes, and perhaps
for a certain sweetness of manner, you need not
have supposed him to be a Bishop.  He did not
talk shop.  He talked as others talk who are
not of the Church.  At once you saw he was
broad-minded.  I do not use the word broad in its
ecclesiastical sense.  There was not a suggestion
of the apostolic or missionary attitude.  That
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P393"></a>393}</span>
was for another place and other circumstances.
<i>Nihil humani</i> might have been his motto, if he had
a motto.  He talked well, clearly, picturesquely,
and in the tone which any guest in a country
house might use.  He did not require you to
remember that he was a Bishop, or even a priest.
He was just himself.  His knowledge and good
sense and felicity of thought and speech were
his own.
</p>

<p>
Queen Alexandra came to tea.  The Archbishop,
as the Rev. Randall Davidson, had been for eight
years Dean of Windsor, and naturally had seen
much of the Royal Family.  I suppose I may say
that he had in time become a trusted friend of
the Queen, perhaps her most trusted adviser.
People who opposed his promotion called him a
courtier, as any man who lives much in the atmosphere
of courts may be.  It was easy to see from
the Queen's manner how much she liked the Bishop
and looked to him for counsel.  If a point were
in question, it was to him she turned.  The Princess
Victoria was with the Queen, and there too was
a friendship.
</p>

<p>
Those were days when affairs in the United States
were in a critical state, or seemed to be, and when
we were beginning to think that the good-will of
other countries might be important to us; as it
was, and always will be, as ours is to them.
So I hope I shall not do amiss if I repeat now a
word which the Queen then said to me:
</p>

<p>
"I hope all the news from your own country is
good.  We all hope that."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P394"></a>394}</span>
</p>

<p>
That expressed the Queen's personal, womanly
sympathy, and something more.  Far gone were
the days when English sympathies were for our
enemies.  They are now for us, and Queen Victoria
was our friend and Queen Alexandra and the late
King were our friends.  They shared the friendship
of their people.  The Queen spoke for herself and
for them.  The Bishop stood by Her Majesty's
side as she said it.  His face brightened.  He
knew, as well as anybody, how much it meant.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLII
<br /><br />
A SCOTTISH LEGEND
</h3>

<p>
Among the recollections of Scotland which
come thronging on from other days, the supernatural
always plays a part.  I admit they are not
easy to deal with.  If you believe in ghosts or in
legends, a great majority of your readers do not
believe in you.  If you are a sceptic, the credulous
pass you by with an air of pained superiority.  If
you neither believe nor disbelieve, you are set
down as an agnostic; and there are great numbers
of excellent people to whom the word agnostic
implies reproach.  An agnostic, however, is not
one who believes or disbelieves, but who, whatever
his private conviction may be, declines either to
affirm or deny the truth of the matter in question.
</p>

<p>
But, although an unbeliever, I know of one story
connecting itself with a famous legend, which is,
so far as it goes, absolutely true, and this I am going
to tell exactly as it happened.
</p>

<p>
In 1883 I was staying at Brechin Castle with
Lord and Lady Dalhousie, and Lady Dalhousie
proposed one morning that we should drive over
to Cortachy Castle to lunch.  Brechin Castle and
Cortachy Castle are both in Forfarshire and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P396"></a>396}</span>
fourteen miles apart.  At that time Cortachy Castle
was let to the late Earl of Dudley; the seventh
Earl of Airlie to whom it belonged having lately
died.  There's a tragic atmosphere for the eighth
Earl was killed at Diamond Hill in South Africa
in 1900; one of the many men of rank and position
and fortune and everything to live for who, in the
early disastrous days of the Boer War, gave up
everything to fight for the flag and for their country
and sovereign.
</p>

<p>
The family name is Ogilvy, and the family name
and title are both old, going back to at least 1491.
They were Ambassadors and great officers of State,
and the seventh Lord Ogilvy was made an Earl.
Two acts of attainder are testimony to the active
part they took in those troubled times, and to their
capacity for holding fast to the losing side.  They
were in the Earl of Mar's rebellion in 1715, and
fought for the Pretender at Culloden.
</p>

<p>
Besides all that, the Ogilvys carried on for
generations a feud with the Campbells.  On both
sides there were burnings and harryings and much
shedding of blood.  There's no need to ask which
of them was the more in fault.  The standards of
those days were not as the standards of ours; and
there was a good deal less of that homage which
vice now pays to virtue.  So it happened that
one day early in the seventeenth century the
Ogilvys found themselves besieged in Cortachy
Castle by the then Earl of Argyll or his lieutenant.
The besiegers sent in a herald with a drummer-boy
to demand the surrender of the castle.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P397"></a>397}</span>
Ogilvy people took the drummer-boy and hanged
him over the battlements, his mother looking from
the camp outside.  As the fashion was in those
days, she launched a curse, or more than one, at
the Ogilvys, and a prophecy.  She foretold that
whenever, through all the ages to come, death or
disaster should visit them they would first hear
the beating of the drum by the drummer-boy.
</p>

<p>
Such is the story as it was told to me.  It is
a well-known tradition, and you are told also that
her prophecy has been strictly fulfilled.  The
beating of the drum by the drummer-boy has been
heard at least once in each generation during the
centuries that ever since then have witnessed the
varying fortunes of this family.  That is a matter
as to which I neither affirm nor deny.  How could
I?  I was not there.  But the narrative is a
necessary preface to the account of the day when the
events I set out to describe did actually occur.
</p>

<p>
At luncheon Lady Dudley, known then and still
as the beautiful Lady Dudley, told us that when
Lord Hardwicke, one of the guests staying with
them, came down to breakfast that morning he
asked her whether the drummer-boy legend applied
to the tenants of the castle for the time being or
only to the Ogilvys.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, only to the Ogilvys, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Then you won't mind my telling you that I
heard the drummer-boy beating his drum last
night."
</p>

<p>
And Lady Dudley added:
</p>

<p>
"I did not mind in the least.  Whether I believe
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P398"></a>398}</span>
in the menace or not, I never heard that it had
anything to do with anybody but the Ogilvys.  If
it could effect anybody in this case it would be Lord
Hardwicke, who heard it, and not us who did not
hear it."
</p>

<p>
With which we naturally agreed.  We finished
our lunch peacefully and pleasantly, and at three
o'clock Lady Dalhousie and I drove back to
Brechin Castle, where there were in all twelve guests.
We dined as usual at a quarter past eight, and
shortly before ten the ladies left the dining-room.
Just after ten the door opened again.  Lady Dalhousie
sailed in, her face brilliant with excitement,
but her manner serene as usual, and said to her
husband:
</p>

<p>
"Dalhousie, Cortachy Castle is burnt to the
ground; the Dudleys are here and you must
come at once."
</p>

<p>
At the drawing-room door stood Lady Dudley,
pale and beautiful, and warned us that her husband
knew as yet nothing of what had happened, and
asked us to be careful to say nothing which should
alarm him.  He was at that time very ill, and his
mind was affected.  The rest of the evening after
we went into the drawing-room passed without any
mention of the disaster to Cortachy.  Lord Dudley
sat down to his rubber of whist, won it, and went
to bed not knowing that the house in which he had
expected to sleep had been destroyed by fire.
When he was told next morning he said, "Very
well,"  and turned again to his newspaper.
</p>

<p>
The explanation was this: After Lady Dalhousie
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P399"></a>399}</span>
and I left Cortachy Lady Dudley took her husband
for a drive, as usual.  As they were returning, late,
they were stopped by a messenger who handed
Lady Dudley a note from the factor, saying the
castle was on fire and there was no hope of saving
it.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" asked Lord Dudley.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing much," answered his wife.  "The
kitchen chimney has been on fire and the place is
in a mess.  I think we had better drive over to
Brechin and ask the Dalhousies to give us dinner."
</p>

<p>
This ready wit carried the day and saved Lord
Dudley the shock which his wife dreaded.  But
the whole company of guests at Cortachy were
also left homeless, and they also came to Brechin
and slept there.  I never quite understood how,
for Brechin Castle can put up, in a normal way,
fourteen people, and we slept that night fifty-six.
But Lady Dalhousie besides being a reigning beauty,
had practical talents and managed it all as if an
inundation of unexpected guests were an everyday
affair.
</p>

<p>
There is one thing to be added.  Past Cortachy
Castle flows a shallow stream with a stony bed.
It was early in September.  The water was very
low, and what there was rippled and broke over
the stones with a noise which, at night and amid
uncertain slumbers, might easily be mistaken for
the beating of a drum by a man whose mind was
full of the drummer-boy story.  After I had heard
about Lord Hardwicke at luncheon I had walked
along the banks of this burn, and the faint likeness
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P400"></a>400}</span>
of the waters beating on the stones to the
beating of a drum occurred to me.  Perhaps a mere
fancy on my part.  I don't press it.  If anybody
prefers to believe in the legend I don't ask him to
believe in my conjecture.  By all means let him
nourish his own faith in his own way.
</p>

<p>
He may like to know, moreover, that Lord Hardwicke,
now dead, was one of the last persons in the
world to conceive or cherish an illusion.  A
well-known man of the world; in his way a celebrity,
if only known for his hats, which were the glossiest
ever seen outside of the stock Exchange.  He had
gone the pace; "climbed outside of every stick of
property he possessed," said one of his friends,
and had acquired a vast and varied stock of
experience in the process.  On the face of it, not at
all the kind of man to believe too much; nor to
believe in anything, as was said of Mr. Lowe, which
he could not bite.
</p>

<p>
He came into the dining-room that night at
Brechin and stayed on the next day.  Among
Lady Dalhousie's guests was Mr. Huxley.  Certainly
a man of the world was Mr. Huxley, but of a
different world from Lord Hardwicke's.  They had
never met.  You might have said they had not a
subject in common.  But they talked to each other,
and to the surprise of the company it presently
became evident that they got on together.  I said
as much to Mr. Huxley afterward.  He answered
in his decisive way:
</p>

<p>
"Don't make any mistake.  Lord Hardwicke
has powers of mind for which even his own set, so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P401"></a>401}</span>
far as I know, has never given him credit.  We
did not talk about the weather.  He was a man
who would put his mind to yours no matter what
you talked about, and it would take you all your
time to keep up with him."
</p>

<p>
Years afterward I reminded Mr. Huxley of this,
and asked him had he ever met Lord Hardwicke
again.
</p>

<p>
"No, never; and I regret it.  But we did not
move quite in the same orbits.  I have hardly seen
anybody since who made such an impression on me.
It's not a question of orbits, it's a question of
men."
</p>

<p>
I asked Lord Hardwicke about the same time
whether he remembered meeting Mr. Huxley.
</p>

<p>
"Remember?  How many Huxleys are there in
the world that you should suppose I could forget
this one?"
</p>

<p>
It is one of the distinctions of English life in
general, and of London, to which New York will
perhaps some day attain, that sooner or later it
brings together men and women, each of the first
rank in his or her own department and each unlike
the other.  They have long understood here that
a society which is not various ends in monotony;
and of all forms of dulness that is the dullest.

CHAPTER XLIII
<br /><br />
A PERSONAL REMINISCENCE OF THE LATE EMPEROR FREDERICK
</h3>

<p>
It used to be said that English sympathies
were given to Austria and not to Prussia in
the war of 1866 because the Austrian railway
officials were so much more polite than the Prussian.
Of the fact that the English wished Austria and
not Prussia to win there is no doubt.  The railway
reason was perhaps a reason, if not the reason.
The organization of Prussia was at that time, as
the organization of Germany, civil and military,
now is, the finest in the world.  But flexibility is
not one of its merits; still less is it distinguished
by consideration for the rights of the non-military
and non-official German world.  The English were
then, as now, a travelling people; and their authority,
if I may use such a word, on the Continent was
greater, or seemed greater, then than now, because
the competition was less.  Americans had not
then begun to swarm across the Atlantic as tourists,
nor was the American language heard on every
hill-side of the Tyrol and on the battlefields of
Silesia.  It was all English, and the English beyond
question found Austria a more agreeable pleasure-ground
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P403"></a>403}</span>
than the wind-swept plateaus of her grim
neighbour to the north.
</p>

<p>
In those days and for many years to come the
English had taken and kept possession of Homburg,
the pretty watering-place near Frankfort.  As in
so many other matters, the fashion was set by the
late King, then Prince of Wales, whom his fellow-subjects,
and presently not a few Americans, followed
in a loyal spirit.  They followed him not less
loyally when he forsook Homburg and journeyed
further afield to Marienbad.  For the truth is
the Germans, and especially the North Germans,
had rediscovered Homburg, and the streets where
for so many years the English accent had been
heard, and almost no other, grew suddenly hoarse
with Teutonic gutturals.  I don't say that
this invasion drove him elsewhere.  He was
himself as much German as English.  But when his
yearly visits in August ceased the English
surrendered Homburg to its real owners, albeit they
rather resented what they called their usurpation.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, one English woman who
clung to it, the Empress Frederick, the late King's
eldest sister and Princess Royal of the United
Kingdom.  Her Royal Highness had married the
Crown Prince of Prussia, afterward the Emperor
Frederick, in 1858, being then just over seventeen
years of age.  For many years she spent part of
each summer in the old Schloss, just outside the
little town; then later built herself a showy villa
on the other flank, and died there in August, 1901.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P404"></a>404}</span>
I don't think the late King had ever revisited
Homburg after that date.
</p>

<p>
She liked the place; liked its pure air, its scenery,
the hills, and woods amid which it lay embosomed;
its pleasant walks and the pleasant life its visitors
led, and some of its residents, though, except the
Princess herself, and the hotel-keepers and the
garrison for the time being, I hardly know who the
residents were.  It was, moreover, a great resort of
invalids who were not ill enough to be sent to a
serious cure.  Many a doctor, in London and
elsewhere, had for a maxim: "When in doubt, choose
Homburg."  Its waters could do you no harm.
Its climate was sure to do you good.  And its
animation, its gaiety, its brilliancy even, during the
six weeks' season were all so many tonics for the
<i>malade imaginaire</i>.
</p>

<p>
Such acquaintance as I had with the Crown
Princess I owed to the late King, who one day
asked me if I knew his sister.  When I said no he
answered, "Oh, but you should; I must arrange
it," and proposed that I should come to tea the
next afternoon at his villa, then the Villa Imperiale,
when the Crown Princess would be there.  Arriving,
I found myself the only guest.  I was presented
to the Princess.  In figure, in face and manner,
she was very like her mother, the late Queen.
The figure was not so stout, the face not so
rubicund, the manner less simple, and therefore with
less authority; but the resemblance in each
particular was marked.  There was even a resemblance in
dress; or it might be truer to say that both the late
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P405"></a>405}</span>
Queen and her eldest daughter showed an indifference
to the art of personal adornment.  Certain
terms have become stereotyped in various worlds
of art.  Early Victorian, mid-Victorian, or merely
Victorian&mdash;are these labels now used by way of
compliment or even of mere description?  I am
afraid they are one and all terms of disparagement.
But it was said truly of the late Queen that it did
not matter what she wore.  Robes did not make
the Queen.  Whatever she wore she was Queen,
and looked the Queen.
</p>

<p>
The Princess had, however, a much greater
vivacity than her mother.  At moments it became
restlessness, and the mind, I thought, could never
be in repose.  There was no beauty but there
was distinction; and in this again she resembled
the Queen.  After her marriage and down to
the day when the Emperor Frederick's death
extinguished her ambitions, the Princess had lived
in a dream-world of her own creation, of which I
will say more in a moment.  Her beliefs were so
strong, her conviction that she knew what was best
for those about her was so complete, that to these
beliefs and this conviction the facts had to adjust
themselves as best they could.
</p>

<p>
Even for the purpose of this audience that
necessity became evident.  I had been presented, of
course, as an American.  Almost at once Her
Royal Highness plunged into American affairs.  She
was keenly interested in educational and social
problems, and explained to me the position of
women in the United States with reference to these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P406"></a>406}</span>
problems.  It appeared she had a correspondent in
Chicago, as I understood, a lady who had been
presented to Her Royal Highness in Berlin, and
from this lady had derived a whole budget of
impressions.  They were extremely interesting, if
only because they were, to me, altogether novel.
But as I was not asked to confirm them, I of course,
said nothing.  Now and then a question was put
which I answered as well as I could, but for the
most part the Princess's talk flowed on smoothly
and swiftly during the better part of an hour.  She
talked with clearness, with energy, with an almost
apostolic fervour, the voice penetrating rather than
melodious.  I said to myself: "All this may be
true of Chicago, but of what else is it true?"  The
Princess had indeed given Chicago as the source of
her information, but it seemed to me that she
generalized from the Windy City to the rest of the
United States, and of such part as I knew I did not
think it a good account.
</p>

<p>
After a time Chicago was dismissed and the talk
drifted away into less difficult channels.  But
the position was always much the same.  The
Princess talked and I listened; the most interesting
of all positions.  I had heard&mdash;everybody had
heard&mdash;a great deal about her views on politics
and on Anglo-German relations and on the internal
affairs of Germany.  On some of these matters she
touched briefly; on all she threw a bright light, for
no matter what the immediate topic of her discourse,
her attitude of mind toward other topics
and toward higher matters of State became visible.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P407"></a>407}</span>
Never for a moment did this stream of talk stop
or grow sluggish.  Carlyle summed up Macaulay,
for whom he had no great respect, in the phrase:
"Flow on, thou shining river."  He might, in a
sardonic mood, have done the same for this
Princess.  After a time I found myself in a dilemma.
An hour and a half had passed; agreeably and
brilliantly, but it had passed, and I had been for
some time expecting the signal which would indicate
that my audience was at an end.  It did not come.
The Princess talked on.  I knew Her Royal
Highness had a dinner engagement, and I knew I had,
and it was already half-past six, and Homburg
dinners are early.  Finally I said I was afraid I had
abused Her Royal Highness's kindness, and might I
be permitted to withdraw.  The permission was
given, the Princess held out her hand, and I went.
</p>

<p>
It was an illuminating interview.  It threw
light on events to come as well as on those of the
past.  Here was a great lady, full of intelligence
and gifts, yet taking views of great public questions
which she held almost alone.  She had made many
enemies.  She was to make many more.  In Berlin
I had heard much.  Prince Bismarck's distrust of
the Crown Princess, and of the Crown Prince on
her account, was known.  It was shared by
multitudes of Germans.  They believed, rightly or
wrongly, that she wanted to Anglicize Germany.
Her ascendancy over her husband was believed
to be complete, and because it was complete the day
of the Crown Prince's accession to the throne was
expected with dread.  During his short reign of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P408"></a>408}</span>
three months&mdash;March 9th to June 15th, 1888&mdash;these
gloomy forecasts could be neither confirmed
nor dispelled.  But they existed, they were general,
and they modified the grief of the German people
at the melancholy ending of what had promised to
be a great career.
</p>

<p>
I suppose it must be said that the Crown Princess
had furnished some material for German forebodings
as to a German future shaped by her or
by her influence.  She talked openly.  She told
all comers that what Germany needed was
parliamentary government as it was understood and
practised in England.  Against that the German
face was set as flint.  In little things, as in great,
she made no secret of her preference for what was
English over what was German.  When the rooms
the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were to
occupy in the Palace of Charlottenburg, outside
Berlin, were to be refurnished, she insisted on
bringing upholsterers from London to do the
work.  Naturally the Berlin people did not like that.
</p>

<p>
Judgment was not her strong point, nor was tact.
If I am to say what was her strong point I suppose
it would be sincerity.  Her gifts of mind were
dazzling rather than sound.  Her impulses were
not always under control.  Her animosities, once
roused, never slept, as Prince Bismarck well knew.
Her will was so vehement as sometimes to obscure
her perceptions.  But hers was a loyal nature
and whatever one may think of her politics, it is
impossible not to regret that the promise of a great
ambition should have come to so tragic an end.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIV
<br /><br />
I
<br /><br />
EDWARD THE SEVENTH AS PRINCE OF WALES&mdash;PERSONAL INCIDENTS
</h3>

<p>
Everything, or almost everything, has been
said about King Edward the Seventh, every
tribute paid him from every quarter of the world;
and the mourning of his people is the best tribute
of all.  I should like to add an estimate from a
different point of view and a tribute, but I suppose
they would have no proper place in these papers,
and I confine myself therefore to memories.  I
will go back to the period when he was Prince of
Wales, and to the place where he put off most of
the splendours belonging to his rank, and where
most of the man himself was to be seen; not once
nor twice, but for years in succession.
</p>

<p>
Homburg was to the Prince of Wales a three
weeks' holiday.  I do not think he took the medical
side of it very seriously.  He drank the waters and
walked, as the doctors bade him, but with respect
to diet he seemed to be his own doctor and his
prescriptions were not severe.  But then nobody, the
local physicians excepted, ever did take Homburg
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P410"></a>410}</span>
very seriously as a cure.  What the Prince liked
was the freedom, of which he was himself the
author.  On occasions of ceremony and in the
general course of his life at home, strict etiquette
was enforced.  At Homburg the Prince used his
dispensing power and put aside everything but
the essentials.  He lived in a hired villa.  He
wore lounging suits in the daytime&mdash;sometimes
of a rather flamboyant colour&mdash;and a soft grey hat.
In the evening a black dining jacket, black tie, black
waistcoat, black trousers, and a soft black Homburg
hat.  The silk hat and the dress coat and
white tie or white waistcoat were unknown.  Most
of the officers of his household were left at home,
but General Sir Stanley Clark was always with him.
</p>

<p>
His way of life was as informal as his dress.  He
was there to amuse himself and it was an art he
understood perfectly.  Homburg is a village, but
it had, or had at that time, many resources.  The
three or four streets of which the place consisted
were so many rendezvous for the visitors.  The
lawn-tennis grounds were another.  The walks in
the woods were delightful.  There were drives
over the hills and far away, in the purest air in
Germany.  If you tired of the little watering-place
or its guests, there was Frankfort, only eight miles
distant, with resources of a more varied kind.  But
in Homburg itself the Kursaal, though there had
been no gambling since 1869, and the hotels, were
always open and sometimes lively.
</p>

<p>
What the Prince liked was society, in one form
or another.  The open-air life suited him.  It was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P411"></a>411}</span>
sufficiently formal but less formal than indoors.
He liked strolling about and meeting acquaintances
or friends.  When you had once seen His Royal
Highness leaning against the railings of a villa&mdash;the
villa stood each in its own ground&mdash;and talking
to a lady leaning out of the first floor window, and
this interview lasting a quarter of an hour, you
felt that the conditions of life and the relations
of royalty to other ranks in life had taken on a
quite new shape in Homburg.
</p>

<p>
But the attitude of respect was maintained.
Certain formalities were never forgotten.  The Prince
was always addressed as "Sir" or as "Your Royal
Highness."  But these observances were not irksome,
nor was conversation restricted or stiffened
by the obligations of deference or by the accepted
conventionalities which, after all, were more
matters of form than of substance.  And in his most
careless moods the Prince had a dignity which was
the more impressive for being apparently unconscious.
Nobody ever forgot what was due to him;
or ever forgot it twice.  It was an offence he did not
pardon; or pardoned only in those who could not
remember what they had never known.  A foreigner,
an American, who erred in pure ignorance
might count on forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
The Prince gave many luncheons and dinners,
almost always at Ritter's or at the Kursaal.  I
should think there was never a day when he did not
play the host.  The dinners at the Kursaal were
given on the terrace, always crowded with other
dinner-parties.  At Ritter's they were on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P412"></a>412}</span>
piazza.  This open-air hospitality was the
pleasanter because it was so seldom possible in
England.  He had brought the art of entertaining to
perfection.  He put his guests, even those who
stood most in awe of royalty, at their ease.  The
costume perhaps helped.  When a company of
people were in dining jackets and the men wearing
their soft black hats, even at table, by the Prince's
command, etiquette became a less formidable thing.
The Prince talked easily, fluently, and well.  He
might ask a guest whom he liked to sit next him,
ignoring distinctions of rank, but during the dinner he
would talk, sooner or later, to everybody.  There
might be a dozen guests, a number seldom exceeded.
I will give you one example of the dialogue which
went on, and no more.  The late Duke of Devonshire,
at that time the Marquis of Hartington,
was sitting nearly opposite the Prince, but at some
distance, and this colloquy took place:
</p>

<p>
"Hartington, you ought not to be drinking all
that champagne."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; I know I oughtn't."
</p>

<p>
"Then why do you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, I have made up my mind that I had
rather be ill now and then than always taking care
of myself."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you think that now, but when the gout
comes what do you think then?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, if you will ask me then I will tell you.  I
do not anticipate."
</p>

<p>
The Prince laughed and everybody laughed.
And Lord Hartington, for all his gout, lived to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P413"></a>413}</span>
seventy-four, one of the truest Englishmen of his
time or of any time.
</p>

<p>
Among the Americans who were presented to
the Prince at Homburg were Mr. Depew and Mark
Twain.  I was not in Homburg when Mr. Depew
first came, but I asked one of the Prince's equerries
to arrange the presentation for Mr. Depew, and I
wrote to Lady Cork begging her to do what she
could for him.  So the formalities were duly
transacted.  The Prince took a liking to the American,
asked him to dine, put him on his right hand, and
listened to his stories with delight.  He told me
afterward that Depew was a new experience.  He
asked him again and again, and the next year also;
I believe several years, or as long as Depew went to
Homburg.  The Prince said:
</p>

<p>
"Depew's stories were not all good, but he told
the bad ones so well that they were better than the
good."
</p>

<p>
My letter to Lady Cork had a fate I did not
foresee, though I ought to have foreseen.  When she
told the Prince that I had written her about Depew
she had my manuscript in her hand.  "Is that
Smalley's letter?  May I see it?" asked the Prince;
took it and read the whole.  It happened that I
was staying at the time with one of her married
daughters, and there was a deal good of family
gossip in the letter.  When the Prince handed it
back there was in his eyes a gleam of that humour
so often seen there, and he said:
</p>

<p>
"Now I know some of the things I have been
wanting to know."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P414"></a>414}</span>
</p>

<p>
And Lady Cork answered:
</p>

<p>
"Sir, we have nothing to conceal from Your
Royal Highness."
</p>

<p>
There was, of course, an intimacy which put the
Prince on his honour.
</p>

<p>
Mark Twain was staying at Nauheim, some
twelve miles away.  He had driven into Homburg
and was wandering about the place when he was
pointed out to the Prince, and was presented.
Mark Twain had at the time no very great care
about his personal appearance, and was very
shabbily dressed.  He was the "Tramp Abroad."  At
first I don't think he much interested the Prince.
His slowness of speech and his unusual intonations
were not altogether prepossessing.  However,
when he had taken his leave the Prince seemed to
think he wished to see him again and said:
</p>

<p>
"I should like to ask him to dinner.  Do you
think he has a dining jacket?"
</p>

<p>
The risk, whatever it might be, was taken, the
invitation was sent, and Mark came to dinner,
dining jacket and all.  But he did not care to adapt
himself to the circumstances; considering, perhaps,
that the circumstances ought to adapt themselves
to him.  The meeting was not a great success, and,
so far as I know, was never repeated.  Socially
speaking, the Mississippi Pilot was an <i>intransigeant</i>
at times, and this was one of the times.  He could
not, I suppose, overcome his drawling manner of
speech nor reduce his interminable stories to
dinner-table limits.  He had the air of usurping more than
his share of the conversation and of the time, which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P415"></a>415}</span>
he certainly did not mean to.  Intentions,
unluckily, count for little.  Men are judged by what
they do, and the general impression was not as
favourable to Mark on this occasion as it would
have been if he had been better known.  Among
all Princes and Potentates there was never one
more willing to make allowances or less exacting
in respect to trivial matters than Mark's host.
But, after all, he was Prince of Wales and the
future King of England, and if you were not
prepared to recognize that, it was open to you to
stay away.
</p>

<p>
Mark Twain, at any rate, was not one of the
Americans who followed the Prince to Homburg.
He met the Prince almost by accident, and returned
from Nauheim by the Prince's invitation for this
not very successful dinner.  His Republicanism
was perhaps of a rebellious kind, and possibly,
though without desiring to, he gave the Prince to
understand as much.  Some of Mark's compatriots
went far in the opposite direction, especially one
or two American women.  There was a handsome
American girl who had found means to be presented
to the Prince; no difficult matter for a pretty
woman at any time.  Then she sent him a photograph
of himself and begged him to sign it.  As I
was passing the Prince one afternoon in the street
he stopped me and pulled a parcel out of his pocket,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"This is a photograph Miss X. sent me to sign,
and I have signed it, and I was just going to leave
it for her at the hotel.  But I am afraid to.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P416"></a>416}</span>
don't know what she may not ask me next.  Would
you mind leaving it for me?"
</p>

<p>
The Prince did not see, but as I went in I saw, on
the porch, the girl herself.  She must have looked
on at what happened and I am not at all sure she did
not hear what the Prince said.  None the less, she
accepted the signed photograph joyfully, and it
always had a place of honour in New York.
"Wasn't it kind of His Royal Highness to give it
to me?" queried this beautiful being, not knowing
that the true story had been told me.  When I
made my report to the Prince I remarked casually
that Miss X. had been sitting on the veranda and
might have seen what took place.  "I hope she
heard also," exclaimed the Prince.  But he did
not quite mean that.  At any rate, he relented
afterward and was seen to be talking to the girl,
whose eyes he could not but admire.

II
<br /><br />
PRINCE OF WALES AND KING OF ENGLAND&mdash;THE PERSONAL SIDE
</p>

<p>
I need not say much about the public life of the
late King nor about the part he played in the
Empire of the world.  But there are certain passages
in his private life and in his relations with the
late Queen which had an effect on his career, and
may be related in whole or in part.
</p>

<p>
The greatness of this reign is the more remarkable
because experience of public affairs came to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P417"></a>417}</span>
King late in life.  He was in his sixtieth year when
he came to the Throne, and during the forty years
when he might have been acquiring invaluable
experience he had been sedulously excluded by the
late Queen from all share in the business of State.
So much is known, and so much is sometimes stated
in the English Press, though stated with caution.
It is the truth, but it is not all the truth.  I believe
it to be also true, that after the death of the Prince
Consort, in 1861, the Queen desired the Prince
of Wales to take up some portion of the duties of
his father, and offered him a place as her private
secretary.  The Prince, for whatever reason,
declined it.
</p>

<p>
He was not much over twenty years of age, and
never in any man, perhaps, was the desire of <i>la joie
de vivre</i> stronger.  Some years later a truer sense
of his position and duties and opportunities came
to him.  He offered to accept, and besought the
Queen's permission to accept, the post she had first
offered him.  Her Majesty made answer that the
post had been filled, and never from that time
onward did she open to the Prince of Wales the door
she then closed.  She left him to amuse himself,
to choose his own associates and his own occupations.
She herself spent six hours a day&mdash;never
less, and often much more&mdash;in reading dispatches
and State papers of all kinds.  The Prince saw
none of them, was present at no interviews with
Ministers, knew nothing at first hand of the
conduct of affairs.
</p>

<p>
Yet the Prince had, in the face of these
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P418"></a>418}</span>
discouragements, an appetite for public business.
He was well informed about it, but only as an
outsider is well informed.  Naturally, the opinion had
grown up that not much was to be expected of the
Prince as King.  The death of the late Queen was
thought to close an era.  It had not occurred to
any one, except perhaps to his nearest friends, to
think of the new King as well equipped for his
Kingship.  True, Lord Salisbury, than whom
there could be no higher authority, speaking in the
House of Lords, had said of the new King upon his
accession that he had "a profound knowledge of
the working of our constitution and conduct of our
affairs."  Lord Salisbury had had his exceptional
means of knowing, and he expressed his own opinion,
a true opinion, but not a general opinion.  I
suppose Lord Rosebery, long intimate with the Prince,
might have said as much.  But to most men such
expressions came as a surprise.
</p>

<p>
I met Sir Francis Jeune at dinner on the evening
after the first Privy Council held by the King,
which Sir Francis had gone down to Osborne to
attend.  He began at once to describe the scene:
</p>

<p>
"The King astonished us all.  We had all known
him as Prince of Wales.  It became clear we had
yet to know him as King.  His air of authority sat
on him as if he had worn it always.  He spoke with
weight, as a King should speak.  It was plain he
had come to the Throne to rule."
</p>

<p>
Ask the Ministers and other great personages
who stood to him in official relations.  Mr. Asquith
has answered for them all:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P419"></a>419}</span>
</p>

<p>
"I speak from a privileged and close experience
when I say that, wherever he was or whatever may
have been his apparent preoccupations, in the
transaction of the business of the State there were never
any arrears, there was never any trace of confusion,
there was never any moment of avoidable delay."
</p>

<p>
In the opinion of the King their time and his
belonged to the public, and neither was to be
wasted.
</p>

<p>
The whole truth about the late King's mission
to Paris has, I think, never been told.  It was
not expedient that it should be told at the time,
nor was it generally known.  But until it is known
full justice cannot be done to the King's courage
and wisdom, or to his direct personal influence on
the course of great affairs.  For it was the man
himself, the King himself, who won this great
victory; not by diplomacy, not by statecraft, but
because he was the man he was.  I tell the story
briefly, but the outlines will be enough.
</p>

<p>
When the King went to Paris to lay the foundations
of a new friendship between France and
England the feeling of the French against the
English ran high.  They had not forgotten nor
forgiven the sympathies of England with Germany
in 1870.  They had not forgotten their own retreat
from Egypt in 1882, and they scored up their own
mistake against England.  They had not forgotten
Fashoda.  The King was warned not to go.  The
French Government warned him.  They could protect
him, they said, against violence but not against
insult.  His own Government thought his visit,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P420"></a>420}</span>
in the circumstances, ill-advised.  Against all
this he set his own conviction that the moment
had come to make an effort for a better
understanding between the two peoples.  Danger did
not deter him.  For personal danger he cared
nothing, and against the danger that any discourtesy
to himself might embitter the two nations he
set the hope of success.  Like the statesman he was,
he calculated forces and calculated wisely.  He
knew that the French, and especially the Parisians,
had always liked him personally and he resolved
to risk it.
</p>

<p>
Neither his courage nor his sagacity was at fault.
At first things went badly.  When he reached the
railway station he was received in silence.  When
he drove from the station to the Embassy there was
not a cheer.  As he went about Paris the next day
the attitude of the Parisians was still sullen, if not
hostile.  But the presence and personality of the
King began after a time to soften hardness.
Before nightfall a cheer or two had been heard in the
streets, and next day all Paris was once more all
smiles and applause.  The King had conquered.
He had won over the people.  He had convinced
Ministers.  He had conciliated public opinion.
He had laid a gentle hand upon old and still open
wounds.  He had shown himself for the first time
a great instrument and messenger of peace, and
had begun the work to which all the rest of his
life was to be devoted.
</p>

<p>
Long before that ever-memorable visit, in France
as in England, the Prince knew all sorts of people,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P421"></a>421}</span>
and was popular with all, and did not mind being
of service now and then to the people whom he
did not know at all.  Dining one night with the
Duc de la Rochefoucauld-Bisaccia in the Faubourg
St. Germain, he was asked by his host to go with
him to the opening reception at the house of a
banker in the Boulevard Haussmann.  The banker
had made a great fortune and had great social
ambitions.  The Prince knew very well why he
was asked, but good-naturedly went.  His going
was chronicled and blazoned next day in every
one of the seventy daily papers of Paris; and the
banker's ambition was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
That was one incident.  Another was his presence
of course in the Prince of Wales period, at a supper
given by the <i>Figaro</i> in its new offices.  Celebrities
of all sorts were there, and the Prince had to sit
still while a too well-known actress from the Bouffes
proposed the Queen's health.  He raised his glass
drank the toast, and said nothing.  It was no
fault of his.  This also found its way into the
French papers; not into the English.  He had many
friendships among artists, men of letters, soldiers,
statesmen.  Between the Prince and the late Marquis
de Galliffet, the Marshal Ney of this last
generation, there was a close tie; two chivalrous souls
who understood each other from the beginning.
He was often to be seen in studios&mdash;M. Detaille's,
M. Rodin's, and many others.  He knew the
theatres in Paris as well as he knew the theatres
in London; perhaps better.  He went to the theatre
primarily, I think, to be amused, and the theatres
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P422"></a>422}</span>
in Paris are more amusing than the theatres in
London.  The most patriotic Englishman may be
content to admit that.
</p>

<p>
If the Prince had any politics abroad they were
kept for his private use.  To the French Republic,
as Republic, and to successive Presidents of the
Republic, he showed nothing but good-will.  To
French statesmen the same; to Gambetta, to
Waldeck-Rousseau, and to M. Clemenceau, whose
originalities and courage interested him long before
that energetic individuality had become Prime
Minister.  They all liked the Prince, but not one
of them ever guessed that from him when King
would spring the new impulse of friendship which
was to make France and England in all but name
allies, and so impose peace upon the restless
ambitions of another great sovereign.  Gambetta, it
is true, foretold a splendid future for the Prince,
without explaining how it was to be splendid.
</p>

<p>
I think if you moved about among Englishmen
one thing would impress you more than all others
in their tributes to their late King.  Not their full
testimony to his greatness as King.  Not their
admiration of his capacities.  Not their pride in
him as a Ruler.  Not their sense of the
incalculable services he has rendered.  Not their
gratitude for these services, deep as that is.  Not
the Imperial spirit and the new value they set upon
the Unity of the Empire.  Not his virtues of any
kind, though to all of them they bear witness.
</p>

<p>
The one thing which would impress you beyond
all this is the affection they bore to him in his lifetime
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P423"></a>423}</span>
and now bear to his memory.  He had known
how to establish new relations between King and
People, relations which had a tenderness and a
beauty unknown before.  They belonged to an earlier
period of history.  They were not quite patriarchal,
as in really ancient days, but were like the relations
which exist in an old family: ties of blood and of
long descent.  They did not exist in the last reign.
There was immense respect for Queen Victoria;
not much sentiment.  She had withdrawn herself
too much from general intercourse, and even from
the ceremonial part of her royal duties.  But this
King, her son, went among the people, lived among
them, lived for them, gave them his constant
thought, won their hearts.  His loss is to them a
personal loss.  They mourn for him as for a King,
and they mourn for him as for a Friend who is gone.
That seems to me the finest tribute of all.

<br /><br />
AS KING&mdash;SOME PERSONAL AND SOCIAL INCIDENTS AND IMPRESSIONS
</p>

<p>
I met at luncheon one of the King's friends,
in some ways one among the most intimate of
the innumerable friends he had; a man, however,
not readily yielding to emotion nor likely to take
what is called the sentimental view.  We began
to talk of the King.  Suddenly he broke off:
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say much.  I loved him."
</p>

<p>
I don't know that I can tell you anything more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P424"></a>424}</span>
characteristic or illuminating than that.  It is the
kind of tribute the King himself would have liked.
And there are millions of Englishmen to-day whose
hearts are full of the same feeling.
</p>

<p>
The King&mdash;the late King&mdash;was a great master
of kingly graces.  He knew, I suppose, more men
and women than any man of his time.  He knew
the exact degree of consideration to which each one
of them was entitled, and exactly how to express
it.  If you desire to form to yourself a conception
of the interval which divides a king, with the
inherited traditions of a thousand years, from the
elected Chief Magistrate of yesterday, you might
do worse than watch the ceremonial customs of
personal intercourse.  We know what the
indiscriminate handshakings by the President are.  We
know that the custom, aided by the incredible
stupidity of the police about him, cost one of them
his life.  We read the other day that a President,
after enduring this exaction for a time, had to stop
it.  His right hand was all but paralysed.  We
have all listened to the Presidential, "I am very
glad to see you," repeated to all comers.  It may
be unavoidable but it all detracts something from
the dignity of the office and the man.
</p>

<p>
This King who is gone gave his hand more often
than any other; but at his own choice and discretion.
It was thought abroad he went great lengths, and
some of the Continental sovereigns and the courtiers
about them criticized him.  They also after a time
imitated him, and sometimes at once.  The present
German Emperor was one of those who took the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P425"></a>425}</span>
hint from his uncle as soon as it was given.  I
told long ago how the Emperor and the then Prince
of Wales in 1889 came on board the White Star
steamship <i>Teutonic</i> lying at Spithead, with a great
company of naval guests, there to witness the great
naval review which never took place.  The First
Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Chamberlain, Lord
Charles Beresford, Mr. Ismay, Mr. Depew, and
many other persons of distinction were grouped
on the main deck.  The Emperor came up the steps
first, and by way of acknowledging their salutations
raised his white cap.  The Prince of Wales
shook hands with all those I have named and with
some others, the Emperor looking on astonished.
Then came a prolonged inspection of the <i>Teutonic</i>,
the finest passenger ship then afloat, the pioneer of
all modern comfort and splendour on the Atlantic,
Mr. Ismay's creation.  There had been much talk
in which Emperor and Prince had both taken part,
and by the time they were ready to leave, the great
German sovereign had learned his lesson.  He
shook hands cordially with Mr. Ismay, in whom he
had recognized a kindred spirit of greatness, other
than his own but not less genuine, and with others.
The faces of his staff were the faces of men amazed,
perplexed, almost incredulous.
</p>

<p>
At drawing-rooms and Courts and levees; in
private houses where he was a guest, whether in
town or country, on the turf, in the theatre, at a
public ceremonial, at a Marlborough House or
Windsor garden-party, the same habit prevailed.
Prince of Wales or King of England, he met his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P426"></a>426}</span>
friends as a friend, and for acquaintances with any
title to recognition he had a pleasant welcome.
It added immensely to his popularity among those
who knew him, and among the millions who never
saw him, but heard.  They thought of him as a
man among men, which he was in every sense, and
as one who thought manhood an honourable thing.
Ask, moreover, any of the equerries or others of his
household.  They will all tell you he was considerate.
He expected each officer to do his duty, and
it was done.  It is often an irksome duty; but he
made it needlessly so.
</p>

<p>
The human side of him was never long hidden.
It is a remark one is tempted to repeat again and
again.  It came out in the services he was for ever
doing; public in their nature, but from a private
impulse.  He met to the full the expectation of the
public, and discharged to the full the obligation of
the Crown in respect of all charities and ceremonials;
and always with a kindly grace which made his
presence and his gifts doubly welcome.
</p>

<p>
With people whom he knew well and liked he
was glad to lay aside etiquette.  I could give you,
but must not, the names of friends to whom he
would often send word in the afternoon that he was
coming to dine that evening and to play bridge
after.  Even a king, and a great king, must sometimes
relax.  He cannot always appear in armour.  His
hostess would meet him at the door with a curtsey,
and then welcome him as a friend; and the talk all
through dinner was intimate and free.  Those
were delightful hours.  So were the days in country
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P427"></a>427}</span>
houses where the King was a guest.  Always, no
doubt, a certain hush in the atmosphere, a certain
constraint if the party was large, but so far as the
King was concerned, if people were not at their
ease it was their own fault.  Everybody knew
where the line was drawn.  Nobody in his senses
over-passed it.  One flagrant instance there was,
not in the country, but at a house in London, at
supper&mdash;a large party.  The hour grew late and
the Prince still sat at his table.  A guest who had
found the champagne to his liking staggered across
the room, steadied himself by a chair and stuttered
out:
</p>

<p>
"I don't know whether Your Royal Highness
knows how late it is, but it's past two o'clock,
and I am going home.  Good-night, sir!"
</p>

<p>
The Prince sat still and answered not.  He saw
the man's condition.  Nobody knew better the
rule that such a company did not break up till the
Prince gave the signal.  He was a man with a great
social position, and not social only.  When he had
departed the Prince finished his interrupted
sentence and the talk went on as before.  Not an
allusion to the offence or the offender.
</p>

<p>
His sense of social responsibility showed itself
in an unexpected form during the Boer War.  There
grew up among the aristocracy a passionate patriotism
which sent heads of great families and elder
and younger sons into the field.  The King thought
this feeling threatened to have grave consequences.
He approved it, of course, and encouraged it, but
he thought limits ought to be set to a fervour which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P428"></a>428}</span>
seemed not unlikely to extinguish an important
part of the nobility.  He sent for a number of men
in great position who had resolved to go and advised
them to wait, saying, with his usual good sense:
</p>

<p>
"Enough men of your class have gone already
to show your devotion; more than are really needed
for the purposes of war.  Wait a little.  If matters
go badly it will be time enough then for you to
depart."
</p>

<p>
One secret of the extraordinary social power of
both Prince and King lay in his knowledge of social
matters.  Nobody was so well informed.  He had
about him numbers of men, and of women, who
took pains to send him, or bring him, the earliest
account of any social incident or gossip.  It was
known that he had these sources of information, and
that whatever was known to any one was known
to him.  Such knowledge as that was a weapon.
It was not one of which he made use, or needed to
use.  The fact that he had it was enough.
</p>

<p>
He liked news also, and took pains to get it.  If
there were a political or Ministerial crisis, you
might be sure that Marlborough House knew all
about it.  He had a certain number of men in his
suite or of his acquaintance from whom he expected,
and generally got, early intelligence.  There was
a sort of competition in supplying him.  If you
were first you were thanked.  If you had been
anticipated, he remarked dryly and with a
good-humoured twinkle in his very expressive eyes:
"Oh, yes, very interesting but I heard it an hour
ago."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P429"></a>429}</span>
</p>

<p>
When I was leaving England in 1895 for America
the Prince gave me his cipher address and asked me
to cable him as often as there was news I thought
might interest him.  That may serve to show us
Americans how much he cared for American matters,
and how completely he returned the good-will
we have always borne him since his visit to the
United States in 1860.  I told the Prince my first
duty was to <i>The Times</i>, since I was going home as
their correspondent.  Subject to that, I should be
glad to send him what I could.  The difference of
time was such that he might well enough get a
dispatch before midnight at Marlborough House,
which could not appear in print till next morning.
"But you know that's just what I should like,"
said the Prince.
</p>

<p>
From beginning to end the late King has lived
his life, ever a full life, possibly not always a wise
life.  Who can be wise always?  Who likes a man
who is always wise?  His faults in youth were of a
kind which were recognized as belonging to men.
The blood which flowed in his veins came down to
him through centuries of ancestors to whom the
restrictions and pudencies, often hypocritical, of
modern days were unknown.  And if we look at the
result, at the crown of all, at the matured character
which made him one of the greatest servants of the
State, of any State, ever known in history, need
there be any criticism or any regret?  Not perhaps
the white flower of a blameless life, but was there
ever one?  But a great human life, compact of
good and ill, and so flowering into the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P430"></a>430}</span>
greatness of a great King.  Perhaps the best summary
is Pascal's:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Qu'une vie est heureuse quand elle commence par
l'amour et qu'elle finit par l'ambition.</i>"
</p>

<p>
For the King's ambition was never for himself;
he had no need to wish to be other than he was.
It was an ambition for the good of his people.
